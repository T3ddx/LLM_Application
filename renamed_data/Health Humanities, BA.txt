Health Humanities, BA
The Health Humanities integrated learning major (ILM) enhances Arts and Science/Maxwell students’ preparation for the health professions through a curriculum that situates health and medicine within complex sociocultural ecologies. Students can supplement any major with the Health Humanities ILM. The curriculum engages with social and ethical questions that are central to all medical fields, as well as broadening students’ appreciation of the different directions they might take in pursuing their interest in health. 
This ILM may be combined with any other undergraduate major with approval by the program director. While certain majors typically serve as the base major for this ILM, students are encouraged to meet with the program director to determine their best choice of a base major. Dually enrolled students must have a base major within Arts and Sciences|Maxwell.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.
