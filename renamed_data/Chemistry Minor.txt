Major in Chemistry
The minor in chemistry is offered to provide students with a basic understanding of the structure and behavior of matter at the atomic and molecular level. Increasingly, the control of matter at the level of individual molecules is becoming the key ingredient in sweeping technological advances such as genetic engineering, micro and molecular electronics, advanced materials, and nanotechnology. A minor in chemistry offers a strong complement to major areas of study such as biology, physics, geology, psychology, engineering, pre-medicine, and pre-professional degree programs.
General Requirements
To complete a minor in chemistry, students take 20 credits carrying a CHE or BCM prefix, including courses that meet requirements A and B below. No part of the minor requirements may be met with transfer or AP credits, nor with independent study (CHE 290, CHE 490), research (CHE 450, BCM 460), or experience credits (CHE 470).
A. Lower-division
Lower-division courses must include either of the following groups:
CHE 106 - General Chemistry Lecture I or
CHE 109 - General Chemistry Lecture I (Honors and Majors)
 CHE 107 - General Chemistry Laboratory I or
CHE 129 - General Chemistry Laboratory I (Honors and Majors)
 CHE 116 - General Chemistry Lecture II or
CHE 119 - General Chemistry Lecture II (Honors and Majors)
 CHE 117 - General Chemistry Laboratory II or
CHE 139 - General Chemistry Laboratory II (Honors and Majors)
or
CHE 275 - Organic Chemistry I and
CHE 276 - Organic Chemistry I Laboratory
B. Upper-division
Upper-division courses must include 12 credits of CHE and BCM courses numbered above 299, including at least one lecture course from among the group CHE 325, CHE 346, CHE 411; and at least one course with an instructional laboratory component. Examples of courses that satisfy the instructional laboratory requirement, and that mesh well with other requirements of the minor, are:
CHE 326 - Organic Chemistry II Laboratory
CHE 335 - Chemical and Biochemical Analysis with Laboratory
CHE 347 - Physical-Analytical Chem Lab
CHE 422 - Inorganic Laboratory Technique
CHE 477 - Proteins and Nucleic Acids Lab
