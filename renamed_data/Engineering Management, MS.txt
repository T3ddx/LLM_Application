Program Description
The combined degree is for students to complete the Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering and the Masters of Science in Engineering Management degrees consecutively, with a goal of completing both degree requirements in five years. 6 credits of 500-level or higher courses may be counted towards both Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees. A block of transfer credits labeled as “transferred from SU undergraduate record” appears on the graduate record and applies credit hours toward the graduate degree, but is not calculated in the graduate GPA.
Admissions
Students must be currently enrolled in the BS Aerospace Engineering program at Syracuse University, and should apply to the combined BS and MS program in the first semester of their third year of study. Admission is based upon academic performance. Students are accepted for graduate study after completion of the third year of study but are not fully matriculated as graduate students until all bachelor’s degree requirements have been met.
BSAE Curriculum
Students must satisfy all the requirements of the Aerospace Engineering, BS.
MSEM Curriculum
Students must also satisfy all the requirements of the Engineering Management, MS, including the Capstone Project MAE 994 and complete two semesters of the MAE Seminar MAE 995.
