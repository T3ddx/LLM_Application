Program Description
The BS Design Studies program will provide students the skill set to become innovative creatives and leaders of cultural change in our global community. The main goals of this program are to educate students in a broad spectrum of design applications and academic studies. Students will consider the impact and influence of design in the context of the overall professional world including many disciplines that intersect the design fields, including engineering, marketing, entrepreneurship, product development, and other fields. One of the program’s primary purposes is to connect design practices to other disciplines at the university and to build on the strong community engagement component that is embedded in all of the existing design majors at SU.
Students transferringmust have a minimum 2.8 GPA.
