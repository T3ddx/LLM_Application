Chemistry, the science concerned with the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter, especially of atomic, elemental, and molecular systems, is taught through courses in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry and through direct participation in original research. Undergraduate majors in chemistry may elect one of four programs, two leading to a B.A. degree, with an emphasis in either chemistry or biological chemistry, and two leading to the B.S. degree with an emphasis in either chemistry or medical chemistry Either B.A. degree program requires fewer credits in chemistry than the B.S. option, and yet provides a foundation in the discipline adequate for either immediate professional engagements or for graduate studies. Students studying for a B.S. degree in chemistry gain a more extensive background as they fulfill a broader range of requirements; they must file a petition with the department chair indicating their intent to secure the B.S. degree before it can be awarded.
Students interested in a B.S. degree in biochemistry should see the biochemistry section here.
For information about certification to teach chemistry at the secondary school level, see Education/Arts and Sciences (dual program) in this section of the catalog.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor’s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.
