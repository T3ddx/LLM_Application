The Policy Studies Minor provides an interdisciplinary approach to understanding problems confronting our society. The minor in policy studies consists of 18 credits, of which at least 12 credits must be in courses numbered 300 or above. We strongly recommend that you try to fit the major into your academic plans rather than the minor.
Required Courses
PST 101 - An Introduction to the Analysis of Public Policy
PST 410 - Practicum in Public Policy
ECN 101 - Introductory Microeconomics
Additional Information
The remaining nine credits can be taken from courses numbered 300 or above from a list of electives. Each semester the Policy Studies Department provides a list of electives available in 102 Maxwell or online at https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/policy-studies/, including Study Abroad options. 
A minor in policy studies is granted after all coursework has been completed. A Petition to the Faculty form should be written listing completed courses that count towards the minor and submitted to Michelle A Walker mawalker@syr.edu.
