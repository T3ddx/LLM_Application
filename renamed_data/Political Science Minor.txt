Political science is the study of politics, government, and their relationship with other aspects of society. Courses in political science enable students to use political theory and empirical analyses to make sense of their world, to interpret political phenomena in the United States and in other areas of the world, and to understand global politics. Political science students gain research, critical thinking, and writing skills that help prepare them for a variety of careers including law, public service, electoral politics, public policy, nonprofit advocacy, international relations, business journalism and communication, and academia.
Note:
Students are required to fulfill the requirements for the B.A. or minor in political science as stipulated in the course catalog for the academic year in which they enter Syracuse University. Graduation with a B.A. or a minor in political science requires a 2.0 average in the upper-division coursework applied toward the major or minor.
