Description:
The 120 credit BS in Food Studies program takes a multi-level and holistic approach to food, from production through consumption. Beyond a core, the curriculum offers required electives in Food Politics, Food Policy, Governance, Community Food Systems and Gastronomy. The major provides excellent preparation for further graduate studies in social science and legal and policy approaches to food. Students with this major might seek employment with government agencies at all levels dealing with food and agriculture issues: food oriented non-governmental organizations that work on sustainability and food security issues; as well as work with food processing, preparation and distribution firms.
  Faculty strengths in international trade and human rights augment local and national policy studies. Our extensive kitchens and a professional staff of chefs, combined with departmental nutrition and public health programs, integrate the new food studies program both in established disciplines and practical experience. The opportunity to pair the food studies major with minors within the Falk College and throughout Syracuse University, such as public health, nutrition, social sciences, policy studies, and communications, offers students unique and marketable complements to their degree program.
