Description:
This combined degree is for students who want to complete consecutively the Bachelor of Science (BSCE) and Master of Science (MSCE) degree in computer engineering. The combined degree is designed to be completed in 5 years. Two courses (6 credits) at the 500- level or higher may be counted towards both the Bachelor’s and the Master’s degrees. The student is expected to be certified for the Bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and for the Master’s degree at the end of the fifth year.
Students should apply to the combined degree program in the summer before their senior year. Admission decisions will be made on the academic performance of applicants.
*Students are accepted for graduate study after completion of the third year of study but are not fully matriculated as graduate students until bachelor’s degree requirements have been met. The undergraduate degree is awarded before completion of the graduate degree. The graduate courses are included in the undergraduate tuition and appear only on the undergraduate record, and grades calculate only toward the undergraduate GPA. A block of transfer credits labeled as “transferred from SU undergraduate record” appears on the graduate record, if needed, and applies credit hours toward the graduate degree.

Description
This combined degree program is offered for the student who wants to complete consecutively the bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science. The combined degree program is designed to be completed in five years, with the student taking two master’s degree courses in the senior year. One course (3 credit hours) at the 500-level or higher may be counted towards both the bachelor’s and the master’s degrees, so that the two degrees together require at least 150 credits.  The student is normally certified for the bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and for the master’s degree at the end of the fifth year.
Students should apply to the combined degree program in the summer before their senior year. Admission decisions will be made on the academic performance of applicants.

Program Description
This 5-year BS/MS program combines two existing programs: the BS in Biotechnology and the MS in Biotechnology. Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary program that offers students an opportunity to take courses in biology, environmental sciences, chemistry, engineering, management, public policy and law. The knowledge gained in these courses will be important for addressing biotechnology-related issues. The combined BS/MS Biotechnology program provides students with advanced scientific training and education, customized to their career plans, as well as targeted professional development and networking experience. It will prepare students for jobs in areas such as the agricultural and food industries, the health professions, environmental conservation, or research in academia.
Admissions
To be eligible for admission to the program, undergraduate students must declare the BS Biotechnology major during the admission process to Syracuse University or anytime thereafter. Students are strongly encouraged to speak to their assigned Biotechnology major advisor regarding the 5-year BS/MS program so that their degree requirements can be met within the designated timeframe.
BS Biotechnology students, and students enrolled in other programs including Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, or others, are eligible to apply to the combined BS/MS Biotechnology program. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis up until July 31st, prior to the beginning of a student’s fourth year as an undergraduate. Interested students must apply through CollegeNet. The materials needed are described below.
Acceptance into the program is based on academic performance, completion of a sufficient proportion of the required BS Biotechnology core courses, and completion of at least one upper-level Biology laboratory course. Decision notifications will be sent to students promptly upon receiving their application.
Students who are not accepted into the combined BS/MS Biotechnology program may still be offered early admission into the regular Biotechnology MS program, at the discretion of the Biotechnology Admissions Committee.
The CollegeNet application consists of the following:
a personal statement (waived for current SU BS Biotechnology majors) outlining the applicant’s interest in the combined BS/MS Biotechnology program (1 page, single-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman font)
a CV or resume 
an unofficial transcript
two (2) faculty recommendation letters
an application.
Program Requirements
Over a period of 5 years, students in this program will complete all the requirements for a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biotechnology, as well as all the requirements for a Master of Science Degree in Biotechnology. Students accepted into the combined BS/MS program will be able to share (“double-count”) up to 15 credits of 500-or 600-level coursework toward the completion of both degrees.
After completion of the program requirements, students will receive the Bachelor’s degree after the fourth year and the Master’s degree after the fifth year.
For curriculum details, see the individual catalog pages for the Biotechnology, BS program and the Biotechnology MS program.

Program Description
The combined degree is for students to complete the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering and the Masters of Science in Civil Engineering degrees consecutively, with a goal of completing both degree requirements in five years. 6 credits of 500-level or higher courses may be counted towards both Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees. A block of transfer credits labeled as “transferred from SU undergraduate record” appears on the graduate record and applies credit hours toward the graduate degree, but is not calculated in the graduate GPA.
Admission
Students must be currently enrolled in the BS Civil Engineering program at Syracuse University, and should apply to the combined BS and MS program in the first semester of their third year of study. Admission is based upon academic performance. Students are accepted for graduate study after completion of the third year of study but are not fully matriculated as graduate students until all bachelor’s degree requirements have been met.
BSCE Curriculum
Students must satisfy all the requirements of the Civil Engineering, BS.
MSCE Curriculum
Students must also satisfy all the requirements of the Civil Engineering, MS.
