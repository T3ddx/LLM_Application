Syracuse University’s Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Health and Physical Education meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification, in both Health AND Physical Education, therefore providing graduates with two New York State teaching certifications (all grades in Health Education and all grades in Physical Education) as well as teacher certification in states with reciprocal agreements. The New York Physical Education certification also qualifies teacher candidates to coach any sport in any school (7-12) in the state of New York.
The degree program emphasizes teaching methods that encourage all children to embrace a physically active and healthy lifestyle with a focus on urban and inclusive settings. The unique location of Syracuse University and the diversity of the surrounding community provide numerous authentic field experiences in urban and suburban settings alike starting in the first year. The School of Education affords its teacher candidates the advantages of resources found only at a major research university, and are enhanced with a strong liberal arts core. Our small class sizes allow teacher candidates to develop strong, personal relationships with their professors, advisors, and peers.
Teacher candidates spend a minimum of 25 hours in the public schools each academic year, culminating with full time student teaching experiences in both health education and physical education in private and public school settings, meeting the time requirements for both as mandated by the NYSED.
The Dual Certification in Health and Physical Education will require a minimum of 136 credits hours and requires teacher candidates to attain a 3.0 GPA by senior year student teaching. Student teaching requirements also include successful completion of the Child Health and Life Safety Seminar and CPR/AED and First Aid certification.
