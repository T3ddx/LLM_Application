Minor Requirements
A minor in Spanish consists of a minimum of 18 credits including SPA 301 and at least 12 credits in other courses numbered 300 or above taught in Spanish. SPA 202 may also count toward the Spanish minor if taken at Syracuse University.

It is recommended, but not required, that at least 6 credits of 300-level courses must be taken before entering the 400 level.
At least 6 credits of 400-level courses are required for the minor.
Note: SPA 101, SPA 102, and SPA 201 DO NOT count toward the SPA major or minor. ONLY 3 CREDITS FROM SPA 202 can be counted toward the SPA major or minor and ONLY IF SPA 202 was taken at SU. Only up to 3 credits from 300 and 400 level conversation courses may be counted toward SPA major or minor. SPA 211 and SPA 212 DO NOT count.
All students must take an online placement exam to determine their appropriate level before enrolling in Spanish courses.
Students, including transfers, with credits earned in Spanish, should consult the major advisor of Spanish as early as possible. Early consultation is also important for students with little or no preparation in Spanish so they may be sure to satisfy requirements within four years.
No course taken as a PASS/FAIL course counts towards the minor.
