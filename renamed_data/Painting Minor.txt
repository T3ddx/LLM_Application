Description
The Painting Minor aims to extend students’ painting skills, develop their art and critical practices, broaden their understanding and abilities to make and discuss art. It also aims to help students understand that a practicing visual artist needs to think globally and be knowledgeable in many cultural and social discourses in order to be conversant in contemporary issues and critical practices.
Whether the minor fulfills students’ desires to study painting or helps bring new skills to their major, the benefit for those who major or minor in painting will be advanced by the conflation of diverse skill sets, opening up creative, intellectual and conceptual content to each others work and class dynamic.
