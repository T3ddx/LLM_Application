Description
The performance program leads to the B.Mus. degree and stresses the development of technical skills, repertory, poise, and overall musicianship. Since most performers continue study beyond the bachelor’s degree, the program also provides a sound basis for advanced study. To reflect preparation for upper-division recital(s), upper-division credits in the principal performance area increase from 2 to 4 credits per hour of instruction.
