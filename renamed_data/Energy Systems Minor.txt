This minor option will provide students enrolled within the College of Engineering and Computer Science with a grouping of courses/electives that will provide academic depth in the field of energy related systems in 4 different but related tracks.
Admission to the energy systems minor is by permission of an academic advisor and requires students to be enrolled in a B.S. program in Engineering within the College of Engineering and Computer Science.
Students with sufficient technical background from other Syracuse University Academic Units may be considered for admission to the Minor in Energy Systems and such decisions will be made by the E&CS Energy Systems Committee.
Course Requirements
The following courses must be taken by all students within the minor regardless of the specific track:
MAE 251 - Thermodynamics or
CEN 252 - Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics I
MAE 548 - Engineering Economics and Technology Valuation
ECN 203 - Economic Ideas and Issues
MAE 551 - Energy Conversion
Track-Specific Courses
In addition, 3 track-specific courses must be taken from a list of required and elective courses for each of the 4 individual tracks. These 4 track specific lists are available from an academic advisor.
1. Thermo-Mechanical Energy Systems Track
Select any 2 of the following courses, plus 1 elective from any of the 4 Energy Systems Tracks:
MAE 553 - HVAC Systems Analysis and Design
MAE 554 - Principles of Refrigeration
MAE 585 - Principles of Turbomachines
MAE 457 - Automotive Engineering for ECS Students
AEE 446 - Air-breathing and Rocket Propulsion
2. Nuclear Energy Track
Required:
NUC 301 - Introduction to Nuclear Engineering and Reactor Safety
Select either of the following 2 courses
NUC 510 - Nuclear Reactor Design, Operation and Safety
NUC 520 - Radiochemistry, Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing and Nonproliferation
Plus 1 of the remaining NUC Electives, or 1 Elective from any other Energy Systems Track:
NUC 510 - Nuclear Reactor Design, Operation and Safety
NUC 520 - Radiochemistry, Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing and Nonproliferation
NUC 530 - Electric Power Generation and Distribution
NUC 540 - Experiential Studies in Nuclear Technology
3. Renewable Energy Track
Select any 2 of the following, plus 1 elective from any of the 4 energy Systems Tacks:
CEN 455 - Materials for Energy Systems
CEN 462 - Biofuels, Bioproducts, and Biorefining or
CEN 421 - Biochemical Engineering
MAE 486 - Fuel Cell Science and Technology
MAE 587 - Design of Solar Energy System
or
PHY 305 - Solar Energy Science and Architectures
MAE 588 - Principles of Wind Turbines
Others to be announced
4. Electric Power Track
Select any 2 electives from the following list:
plus 1 elective from any of the 4 Energy Systems Tracks. (Note: You can take either ELE 514 or ELE/NUC 530 but not both)
ELE 324 - Electromagnetics
ELE 416 - Electromechanical Devices
Notes
Because MEE students take ECN 203 as a required SS/H course they must take another SS/H elective as part of their minor.
