Writing Skills Requirement
Return to: College of Arts and Sciences 
  Writing Skills (3 courses)
Students are required to complete the following:
The first of these courses is chosen from Writing Studio 1: Practices of Academic Writing (WRT 105) or Composition for Non-Native Speakers of English (ENL 211).
During the spring semester of their second year, students will take the higher level Writing Studio 2: Critical Research and Writing (WRT 205) or Advanced Academic Writing and Research for Non-Native Speakers of English (ENL 213).
Before WRT 205 or ENL 213 is taken, students will take a Writing-Intensive course in a subject matter other than writing, a course that has been specially designed to give attention to developing writing ability while studying another subject matter. The list of approved Writing-Intensive courses will be found in the Writing-Intensive section. These courses that fulfill the Writing-Intensive Course requirement must be successfully completed by the student in the academic year in which they are listed in the Liberal Arts Core Guidebook.
