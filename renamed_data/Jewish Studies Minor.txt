This interdisciplinary minor explores Modern Jewish culture and religion. Faculty research and teaching focus on the Hebrew Bible, Hebrew and Yiddish fiction, European and American literature, Jews in modern Europe, the arts, modern Judaic thought and culture, Israel, and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The minor provides broad, interdisciplinary knowledge of Jewish experience both historical and contemporary, and is meant to prepare students for further pursuits in Jewish culture, history, and religion upon graduation, either academically or in private life. The Judaic Studies Program offers courses and advising to students, and a range of events (lectures, films, musical performances, etc.) for students, faculty, and the larger community. Graduate students are eligible to apply for the Benjamin Fellowship, and all students may submit Holocaust-related papers to the undergraduate and graduate Kalina Prize competition.
