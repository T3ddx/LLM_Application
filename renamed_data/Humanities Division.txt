Humanities Division
Return to: College of Arts and Sciences 
The Humanities Division encompasses the history, theory, analysis and criticism of language, literature and other texts, religion, art, and music; and the examination of fundamental questions arising in the human search for values, knowledge, purpose, and meaning. These are central concerns of the departments of African American Studies; English; Languages, Literatures and Linguistics; Art and Music Histories; Philosophy; Religion; Women’s and Gender Studies; and Writing Studies, Rhetoric, and Composition. Hence, most courses satisfying the Humanities Division requirements come from these departments.
The Humanities List
Students must take at least four courses from the following list, including a two-course sequence as indicated, to complete the requirement for four courses in this division. No more than three courses may be taken from a single department or program (even if the courses of the department or program are in more than one division).
