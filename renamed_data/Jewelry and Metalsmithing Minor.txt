Description
The curriculum gives the minors the same base of knowledge as the majors, but allows the minors to choose a path within the program that suits their interests. The student may decide to take jewelry oriented courses, metalsmithing courses, or a combination of both. The curriculum also gives the students an historic understanding of the field and an opportunity to discuss many of the issues faced by jewelers and metalsmiths now.
