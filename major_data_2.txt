Anthropology explores the entire range of human experiences in the past and present. Our department offers undergraduate courses covering the breadth of the discipline, including physical anthropology (the study of human evolution and biological variation); archaeology (the study of prehistoric and historic cultures through material remains); linguistics (the study of language - its structure, historic developments, and social aspects); cultural anthropology (the study of contemporary societies); and applied anthropology (the use of anthropological methods and theory to solve real-world problems). Ongoing research by our faculty and graduate students covers a broad array of topics, from slave settlements in Jamaica to women and development in India; from religious movements in Brazil to sustainable agriculture in Nepal; from forestry in Kenya to the Underground Railroad in Syracuse. Current research sites span the globe, including South and East Asia, South and North America, West and East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Caribbean.
Undergraduate training in anthropology is useful in many fields, including education, international business, law, journalism, cultural resources management and public service. For students interested in future graduate studies in anthropology, our program offers a solid ground in theory, methods, ethics and practical application.
Undergraduate students are encouraged to explore anthropology not only through coursework, but with direct involvement in laboratory research and field work. Our department has fully equipped archaeology and physical anthropology laboratories, providing a variety of research opportunities. A well-established archaeological field training program is offered each summer. Field experience in cultural anthropology is available through community internships, independent studies, and ongoing faculty research. We also recommend that students consider spending a semester or two in another country through the University�s SU Abroad Program, as a way of enhancing their major with true cross-cultural experience. For information, contact the Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Director.

Description:
Arabic is spoken by over 300 million speakers in 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. It is also an official language in 26 countries, the African Union, the Arab League, and the United Nations. It is the main medium of communication in business, government, and the media throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Currently, Arabic is designated as one of the critical languages by the federal government, which has been investing substantially in increasing the number of Americans with high proficiency in Arabic.
The increasing number of students enrolling in Arabic language, linguistics, and culture courses in Syracuse University in recent years and the high level of retention of those students in consecutive years demonstrate the great demand for the study of Arabic.
A minor in Arabic will prepare students to read, write, and communicate orally in Arabic at a functional level in an international setting, and to recognize and respond to cultural patterns of Arabic-speaking peoples. It will allow students majoring in other disciplines, e.g. Middle Eastern Studies, Political Science, Business, Journalism, International Relations, Public Relations, Translation, etc. to employ their knowledge of Arabic language and culture in their future careers. A minor in Arabic will increase students� attractiveness in the job market, especially with the present significant demand for Americans who can demonstrate high proficiency in Arabic.
Admission:
Students should have completed the prerequisite ARB 102 or equivalent.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Express themselves in Modern Standard Arabic on a variety of familiar, practical, professional, and everyday topics
2. Read and comprehend Modern Standard Arabic texts on a variety of familiar, practical, professional, and everyday topics
3. Demonstrate knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic structure and grammar and write paragraphs and short essays on a variety of familiar, practical, professional, and everyday topics
4. Comprehend most Modern Standard Arabic speakers when they speak clearly on familiar, practical, professional and everyday topics
5. Demonstrate through discussion and social interaction profound and critical knowledge of many aspects of Arabic cultures and societies, through examples from history, art, literature, religion, politics, film, and music
Curriculum Requirements:
The Arabic Studies Minor requires at least 18 credits; at least 12 of the credits have to be taken at the 300 level and above. The courses in the table below are required. Previously approved upper-division Arabic language, literature, or culture courses through one of our Study Abroad centers can be considered as substitute to these courses, with prior approval by the Arabic coordinator. The courses ARB 201, ARB 202, ARB 301 and ARB 302 should be substituted with an equivalent level or higher. Each of the two courses, ARB 336 (Arabic Cultures) and ARB 326 (Structure of Standard Arabic) could be substituted with an upper-division Arabic language, literature, or culture course at the 300 level or above, provided that the language courses are different from ARB 301 and ARB 302. If more than one upper-division course is substituted, the substituting courses should be different from each other.
ARB 201 - Arabic III (offered every fall semester)
ARB 202 - Arabic IV (offered every spring semester)
ARB 301 - Arabic V (offered every fall semester)
ARB 302 - Arabic VI (offered every spring semester)

In Addition
Students may petition to include 3 credits of studio art coursework at any level in the required 30 credits. Students may also petition to have up to 3 credits of appropriate courses in art history (non-HOA courses) count toward the required 30 credits.
Distinction in Art History
Art history majors who have earned a GPA of at least 3.4 by the end of their junior year and a cumulative departmental GPA of at least 3.7, are eligible for distinction. An announcement about the distinction in art history will be made during the first week of Senior Seminar (HOA 498), so that all graduating seniors are aware of it. Qualified students can approach a faculty member regarding pursuing distinction, or individual faculty members can invite students to do so. Candidates for distinction must take the Senior Seminar. In addition, they must submit either a Capstone Project (Honor�s Thesis), or a 15-20 page-long art history research paper from an upper division HOA class (excluding bibliography and end/footnotes) that has earned at least an A-. Alternatively, students can develop a shorter writing sample into a longer research paper worthy of being submitted for distinction, through a 1-credit Independent Study (HOA 490) supervised by a faculty member in the department (the Independent Study project must earn at least an A- to be considered for distinction).
