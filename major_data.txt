Anthropology explores the entire range of human experiences in the past and present. Our department offers undergraduate courses covering the breadth of the discipline, including physical anthropology (the study of human evolution and biological variation); archaeology (the study of prehistoric and historic cultures through material remains); linguistics (the study of language - its structure, historic developments, and social aspects); cultural anthropology (the study of contemporary societies); and applied anthropology (the use of anthropological methods and theory to solve real-world problems). Ongoing research by our faculty and graduate students covers a broad array of topics, from slave settlements in Jamaica to women and development in India; from religious movements in Brazil to sustainable agriculture in Nepal; from forestry in Kenya to the Underground Railroad in Syracuse. Current research sites span the globe, including South and East Asia, South and North America, West and East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Caribbean.
Undergraduate training in anthropology is useful in many fields, including education, international business, law, journalism, cultural resources management and public service. For students interested in future graduate studies in anthropology, our program offers a solid ground in theory, methods, ethics and practical application.
Undergraduate students are encouraged to explore anthropology not only through coursework, but with direct involvement in laboratory research and field work. Our department has fully equipped archaeology and physical anthropology laboratories, providing a variety of research opportunities. A well-established archaeological field training program is offered each summer. Field experience in cultural anthropology is available through community internships, independent studies, and ongoing faculty research. We also recommend that students consider spending a semester or two in another country through the University�s SU Abroad Program, as a way of enhancing their major with true cross-cultural experience. For information, contact the Department of Anthropology Undergraduate Director.

Description:
Arabic is spoken by over 300 million speakers in 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. It is also an official language in 26 countries, the African Union, the Arab League, and the United Nations. It is the main medium of communication in business, government, and the media throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Currently, Arabic is designated as one of the critical languages by the federal government, which has been investing substantially in increasing the number of Americans with high proficiency in Arabic.
The increasing number of students enrolling in Arabic language, linguistics, and culture courses in Syracuse University in recent years and the high level of retention of those students in consecutive years demonstrate the great demand for the study of Arabic.
A minor in Arabic will prepare students to read, write, and communicate orally in Arabic at a functional level in an international setting, and to recognize and respond to cultural patterns of Arabic-speaking peoples. It will allow students majoring in other disciplines, e.g. Middle Eastern Studies, Political Science, Business, Journalism, International Relations, Public Relations, Translation, etc. to employ their knowledge of Arabic language and culture in their future careers. A minor in Arabic will increase students� attractiveness in the job market, especially with the present significant demand for Americans who can demonstrate high proficiency in Arabic.
Admission:
Students should have completed the prerequisite ARB 102 or equivalent.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Express themselves in Modern Standard Arabic on a variety of familiar, practical, professional, and everyday topics
2. Read and comprehend Modern Standard Arabic texts on a variety of familiar, practical, professional, and everyday topics
3. Demonstrate knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic structure and grammar and write paragraphs and short essays on a variety of familiar, practical, professional, and everyday topics
4. Comprehend most Modern Standard Arabic speakers when they speak clearly on familiar, practical, professional and everyday topics
5. Demonstrate through discussion and social interaction profound and critical knowledge of many aspects of Arabic cultures and societies, through examples from history, art, literature, religion, politics, film, and music
Curriculum Requirements:
The Arabic Studies Minor requires at least 18 credits; at least 12 of the credits have to be taken at the 300 level and above. The courses in the table below are required. Previously approved upper-division Arabic language, literature, or culture courses through one of our Study Abroad centers can be considered as substitute to these courses, with prior approval by the Arabic coordinator. The courses ARB 201, ARB 202, ARB 301 and ARB 302 should be substituted with an equivalent level or higher. Each of the two courses, ARB 336 (Arabic Cultures) and ARB 326 (Structure of Standard Arabic) could be substituted with an upper-division Arabic language, literature, or culture course at the 300 level or above, provided that the language courses are different from ARB 301 and ARB 302. If more than one upper-division course is substituted, the substituting courses should be different from each other.
ARB 201 - Arabic III (offered every fall semester)
ARB 202 - Arabic IV (offered every spring semester)
ARB 301 - Arabic V (offered every fall semester)
ARB 302 - Arabic VI (offered every spring semester)

Distinction in Art History
Art history majors who have earned a GPA of at least 3.4 by the end of their junior year and a cumulative departmental GPA of at least 3.7, are eligible for distinction. An announcement about the distinction in art history will be made during the first week of Senior Seminar (HOA 498), so that all graduating seniors are aware of it. Qualified students can approach a faculty member regarding pursuing distinction, or individual faculty members can invite students to do so. Candidates for distinction must take the Senior Seminar. In addition, they must submit either a Capstone Project (Honor�s Thesis), or a 15-20 page-long art history research paper from an upper division HOA class (excluding bibliography and end/footnotes) that has earned at least an A-. Alternatively, students can develop a shorter writing sample into a longer research paper worthy of being submitted for distinction, through a 1-credit Independent Study (HOA 490) supervised by a faculty member in the department (the Independent Study project must earn at least an A- to be considered for distinction).

More than two thirds of the Asian American population is comprised of immigrants whose personal and migration histories, educational achievements and attitudes have been molded by their Asian heritages and who continue to maintain connections with their homelands. This program was developed out of an awareness that we cannot understand Asian Americans without understanding the histories and cultures of Asia and vice versa, that we cannot understand contemporary Asia without understanding how American politics, capital, religion, culture and Asian American diasporas have shaped countries in that continent.
The minor will consist of 18 credits, 12 of which must be in advanced 300 or higher level coursework.
18 credits, 12 at the 300 or higher level

Students majoring in biology establish a general background in the discipline through a series of first-year/sophomore-level core courses that preview the major sub-disciplines of biology. This introductory program is followed by courses that allow the student to focus on more advanced material.
The major in biology leads to either the B.A. or the B.S. degree. The B.S. degree is intended for students interested in graduate study in biological science or the health professions (medicine, dentistry, or veterinary medicine). In addition to biology requirements, students pursuing a B.S. degree take general chemistry, organic chemistry, and calculus. Students are also encouraged to gain practical experience and academic credit through the University. 
The B.A. degree is intended for students who wish to pursue technical or science-related careers that do not require a graduate or professional degree, or careers outside of biology in which a background in science may be useful, such as science writing, business, or law. Although the first-year/sophomore-level core biology course requirements for the B.A. and the B.S. degrees are similar, there are key differences. The B.A. degree requires fewer courses in chemistry, mathematics, and upper division Biology.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. By the end of their first year, students will be able to recognize and distinguish theories, concepts and principles, as defined by the Vision and Change core, from the major sub-fields of biology including molecular, cellular and developmental biology; physiology; and ecology and evolution.
2. By the end of their degree, students will be able to analyze, synthesize and apply theories, concepts and principles, as defined by the Vision and Change core, from the major sub-fields of biology listed above.
3. Apply skills in biological research and demonstrate knowledge of the nature and practice of science.
4. Apply communication/collaboration skills relevant to biological sciences
5. Apply quantitative reasoning and methods to solve problems in the biological sciences.
6. Describe the relationship between science and society; identify ways that this has had both positive and negative impacts.

Chemistry, the science concerned with the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter, especially of atomic, elemental, and molecular systems, is taught through courses in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry and through direct participation in original research. Undergraduate majors in chemistry may elect one of four programs, two leading to a B.A. degree, with an emphasis in either chemistry or biological chemistry, and two leading to the B.S. degree with an emphasis in either chemistry or medical chemistry Either B.A. degree program requires fewer credits in chemistry than the B.S. option, and yet provides a foundation in the discipline adequate for either immediate professional engagements or for graduate studies. Students studying for a B.S. degree in chemistry gain a more extensive background as they fulfill a broader range of requirements; they must file a petition with the department chair indicating their intent to secure the B.S. degree before it can be awarded.
Students interested in a B.S. degree in biochemistry should see the biochemistry section here.

Why Study Classics?
The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.
L.P. Hartley
Students approaching Classical Studies for the first time may wonder how the study of languages and cultures from antiquity is relevant in the digital era; why study Classics?
First, Classics provides students with many fascinating intellectual opportunities. Because the range of Greek and Latin literature is so diverse, students interested in history, drama, poetry, political science, or philosophy, will find ample material to stimulate their curiosity. Moreover, students will develop the ability to read some of the most influential works of western literature in their original languages, and learn about cultures that are radically different from our own, yet at the same time provide the foundation of many modern ideas and institutions.
Since Classical Studies have traditionally played a central role in education they have left an indelible mark on the intellectual, political, and artistic development of Western Civilization. Countless authors, as diverse in time and place as Dante and Derek Walcott, have looked for inspiration to the classical tradition; political theorists and statesmen, including Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, developed their political ideals through a close reading of ancient historians such as Polybius and Thucydides. Understanding the reception of classical texts and the ways subsequent generations adapted and modified classical ideals will grant students a greater degree of proficiency in civic and cultural history, and help them better understand the cultural politics of their own world.
While not all Classics students wish to become classical scholars, a major in Classics is among the most impressive degrees to have when applying for a job in other fields. The work ethic required for success in the languages, the intellectually challenging nature of the grammar and syntax of Greek and Latin, and the interdisciplinary nature of the field are only a few reasons why Classics majors are highly respected and sought-after job candidates. Furthermore, because of the historical role of Classics in education many terms and concepts in various fields are derived from Greek or Latin. For these reasons, Classics majors often find employment in Law, Medical Sciences, Government/Politics, Writing and Journalism, and Education.
Why study Classics? To find a challenging and immensely rewarding field of study, and to explore the familiar yet foreign country that is our past.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Demonstrate competence in one of the core languages of the Classical Era
2. Demonstrate familiarity with the literature of the Classical Era
3. Demonstrate familiarity with the political and social history of the Classical Era
4. Demonstrate an understanding of the art, archaeology, and material culture of the Classical Era
5. Demonstrate an understanding of the religious and philosophical views of the Classical Era

Countless authors, as diverse in time and place as Dante and Derek Walcott, have looked for inspiration to the classical tradition; political theorists and statesmen, including Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, developed their political ideals through a close reading of ancient historians such as Polybius and Thucydides. Understanding the reception of classical texts and the ways subsequent generations adapted and modified classical ideals will grant students a greater degree of proficiency in civic and cultural history, and help them better understand the cultural politics of their own world.
While not all Classics students wish to become classical scholars, a major in Classics is among the most impressive degrees to have when applying for a job in other fields. The work ethic required for success in the languages, the intellectually challenging nature of the grammar and syntax of Greek and Latin, and the interdisciplinary nature of the field are only a few reasons why Classics majors are highly respected and sought-after job candidates. Furthermore, because of the historical role of Classics in education many terms and concepts in various fields are derived from Greek or Latin. For these reasons, Classics majors often find employment in Law, Medical Sciences, Government/Politics, Writing and Journalism, and Education.
Why study Classics? To find a challenging and immensely rewarding field of study, and to explore the familiar yet foreign country that is our past.

Why Study Classics?
The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.
L.P. Hartley
Students approaching Classical Studies for the first time may wonder how the study of languages and cultures from antiquity is relevant in the digital era; why study Classics?
First, Classics provides students with many fascinating intellectual opportunities. Because the range of Greek and Latin literature is so diverse, students interested in history, drama, poetry, political science, or philosophy, will find ample material to stimulate their curiosity. Moreover, students will develop the ability to read some of the most influential works of western literature in their original languages, and learn about cultures that are radically different from our own, yet at the same time provide the foundation of many modern ideas and institutions.

Economists analyze the internal functioning of markets and market outcomes. While modern economics focuses on market forces, markets function imperfectly in some cases and that introduces scope for policy action. Our curriculum emphasizes the application of economics to the study of public policy issues and the role of government in a market economy. Examples include analysis of international trade and relations, economic behavior in the workplace, health care, taxation, and numerous other spheres of a global economy. Students who major in economics prepare themselves for a variety of careers. Some move on to graduate study in economics and become professional economists; the majority, however, pursue careers in law, public policy, government, and many aspects of business, including banking and financial analysis, management, and marketing. Consequently, some students choose to pursue double majors and dual degrees. Further information on these programs is available in the Academic Rules and Regulations section of this catalog or in the economics department office.

The Department of English offers programs in textual and cultural studies and in creative writing. Courses deal with both written and film/screen texts, and study such problems as the nature and implications of reading and interpretation, the production of meaning in language and culture, and the nature of literary forms. Creative Writing courses include classes on general forms (fiction, poetry, creative non-fiction) and workshops where students develop their own writing.

Minor in English and Textual Studies
The English and Textual Studies minor requires 18 credit hours of coursework (generally, six courses). Six credit hours (two courses) must be in courses at the 100 or 200 level (lower division) and twelve credits (four courses) must be in courses numbered 300 or above (upper division). One of the lower division courses must be ENG 242 - Reading and Interpretation. Students may include among their upper division courses either one approved course offered by the Writing Program (WRT) numbered 300 or above, or one approved Literature in Translation course (LIT) numbered 300 or above.
Please note that ENG 105 and ENG 107 and Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate credits do NOT count toward the lower division credit requirements for an English and Textual Studies minor. In addition, no grade lower than a C- for any class will count towards the ETS minor.

The English Education program at Syracuse University is a dual program between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences, in which students earn one major from each school/college.  The undergraduate major in English and Textual Studies emphasizes historical, theoretical, and political modes of inquiry. The curriculum stresses not only what is read but how. Students select English courses that align with the secondary school curriculum, include poetry, Shakespeare, history and structure of the English language, creative nonfiction, and multicultural literature. In English Education courses, students learn how to address all learners� needs in a changing and diverse society, with particular emphasis on cultural and linguistic diversity, integration of media and technology, multi-level teaching, and standards-based assessment.

Environment and Society Minor

Director of Undergraduate Studies

Department of Geography and the Environment

The Environment and Society (E&S) minor examines the social dimensions of environmental issues and sustainability. Through a range of interdisciplinary course offerings, it seeks to foster environmental literacy and citizenship among students. Those completing the minor will gain a deep understanding of the political, cultural, and economic factors that affect our use of the environment. Courses in the minor draw primarily from the social sciences and humanities and ask a variety of questions. Who determines how the environment is used? How has the way we value nature and wildlife changed over time? How do social divisions influence who is affected by climate change, pollution, or natural disasters? How can we create a more sustainable society?
The Environment and Society minor is an excellent accompaniment to majors in other fields. For those interested in the natural sciences, the minor offers perspectives on the social dimensions of nature less emphasized in science courses. For those interested in public policy and economics, it allows students to delve more deeply into environmental matters. For those interested in business, finance, or management, the minor offers an opportunity to learn more about the relationships between environment, economy, and society. Finally, for those seeking a future in the media, it enables students to learn more about the environmental issues they will report on during their career. In short, the E&S minor is a program for those who care about nature and want to find solutions to environmental problems. It is also a way for students to document their knowledge and expertise in environmental issues for the growing number of �green� jobs and industries.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Describe and explain the features, patterns, and processes of the physical environment, and the human impact on natural systems
2. Explore and critically reflect on the political, cultural, and economic factors that affect our use of the environment
3. Discuss and think critically about who determines how the environment is used
4. Discuss and think critically about the way we value nature and wildlife and how those values have changed over time
5. Discuss and think critically about how social divisions influence who is affected by climate change, pollution, or natural disasters
6. Discuss and think critically about how we can create a more sustainable society

Professionals in technically demanding fields are commonly asked to apply their expertise to other seemingly unrelated disciplines. As a result, they must have a comprehensive understanding of not only their own field, but also secondary knowledge of another broadly based, often interdisciplinary, field of study. A chemist might lend his or her expertise to a matter of legal or ethical importance. A curator might evaluate scientific and historical evidence about a painting�s authenticity. A journalist might research a story involving science, medicine, and technology.
The major in Ethics will integrate with the following majors: management, television/radio/film, broadcast/newspaper journalism, engineering, computer science, biology, biomedical and chemical engineering, political science, public health, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and international relations, but other combinations may also be possible with approval of the director.
This ILM may be combined with any other undergraduate major with approval by the program director. While certain majors typically serve as the base major for this ILM, students are encouraged to meet with the program director to determine their best choice of a base major. Dually enrolled students must have a base major within Arts and Sciences|Maxwell.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.
This synergistic approach adds scholarly mettle to both the major and the interdisciplinary program, while exploiting their connective properties. First- and second-year courses contemplating the Integrated Learning Program in Ethics are advised to take one of the following courses: ANT 185, PHI 191/PHI 192/PHI 209, REL 252, or WGS 230/SOC 230.
Admittance requires an overall 3.0 GPA and a B or better in both PHI 391 and PHI 393.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Understand and be able to explain core ethical concepts and theories and their historical development
2. Critically evaluate ethical theories and arguments
3. Write clearly and concisely, and organize their writing effectively
4. Conduct independent research on a topic in ethics by finding, assessing, and employing relevant literature
5. Understand and be able to explain moral problems that arise in the sciences, politics, professional fields, or everyday life
Requirements

Distinction in Fine Arts (3 credits, required only for students earning a degree with distinction)
Majors who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.7 will be invited to earn a degree with distinction. In order to earn this honor, students are required to enroll in either HOA 490 or HOM 490 (dependent on subject matter). These students will work independently, under the supervision of a faculty member, to complete a large-scale project in some aspect of art or/and music history. Students will determine the topic for their Distinction Project in consultation with a thesis advisor, whom they will choose from among the Art and Music Histories faculty (in exceptional cases other faculty may serve in this capacity). The thesis will also be evaluated by a second reader, chosen by the thesis advisor (in consultation with the student) from other faculty in the Art and Music Histories department or related disciplines. In most cases, the project will take the form of a formal essay approximately 6000 words in length. Alternative types of projects are also possible, provided they meet with the approval of both the thesis advisor and Fine Arts director. Students completing a Capstone Project for an Honor�s program thesis are welcome to submit this work for consideration. The Distinction Project may be substituted for any of the required 18 upper elective credits for the major. All projects must be awarded at least an A- to receive distinction. Credits from the HOA/HOM 490 Distinction project will count toward the upper division requirements.

Syracuse University�s curricular programs in forensic science, supported by the Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute in the College of Arts and Sciences, apply broad interdisciplinary scientific research and theory to real-world legal and security issues. Students can pursue an M.S. in Forensic Science, a combined M.S. in Forensic Science and J.D. in Law, an M.S. in Biomedical Forensic Sciences, a Certificate of Advanced Study in Medicolegal Death Investigation, an undergraduate Integrated Learning Major in Forensic Science, a Minor in Forensic Science, or a Certificate in Medicolegal Death Investigation.

Minor in Forensic Science
The minor in forensic science provides students with an understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles behind the application of scientific techniques to forensic investigations and to the criminal justice system. Recent advances in basic scientific research have had a rapid and dramatic impact in these fields and it is only through an understanding of these fundamental scientific concepts that the legal system may be effective in criminal investigations. A minor in forensic science offers a strong complement for students interested in criminal justice to major areas of study such as anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, geology, psychology, engineering, pre-medicine, sociology, and pre-professional degree programs. The minor in forensic science is open to all students at Syracuse University.

Description
Professionals in technically demanding fields are commonly asked to apply their expertise to other seemingly unrelated disciplines. As a result, they must have a comprehensive understanding of not only their own field, but also secondary knowledge of another broadly based, often interdisciplinary, field of study. A chemist might lend his or her expertise to a matter of legal or ethical importance. A curator might evaluate scientific and historical evidence about a painting�s authenticity. A journalist might research a story involving science, medicine, and technology.
Forensic Science is a 25- to 26-credit Integrated Learning Major (ILM) that can complement a variety of other majors, including Anthropology, Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Earth Sciences, Linguistics, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, and Sociology. Other majors will be considered based on student proposals that include appropriate connection courses and with the approval of the director.
This ILM is designed to provide a broad exposure to the field, increasing employability in a variety of settings related to Forensic Science. Like all ILMs, Forensic Science includes a capstone project where students make contacts with practitioners in their field, complete a research project, and present their findings.
This Integrative Learning Major is intended to provide a broad exposure to the field of forensic science, increasing employability in a variety of careers that relate to forensic science. However, this major will not generally be sufficient to prepare students for forensic laboratory positions unless it is paired with a chemistry, biochemistry, or biology major.  Additionally, students interested in a job in the forensic DNA field should be aware that certain undergraduate coursework is required for laboratory positions in the US including courses that cover the subjects of molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, and statistics.
This ILM may be combined with any other undergraduate major with approval by the program director.

Have you ever wondered why the world works the way it does? So do geographers, who study everything from economic, political, and cultural relations within and between countries, to environmental practices of different people, to the physical and biological processes of the planet - in brief, the spatial aspects of human life and the natural environment. At Syracuse University, geographers study globalization, environmental change and history, mapping and spatial techniques, immigration, urban and cultural politics, social movements, and surface processes of the physical environment. As a major, geography gives you a range of skills AND a new perspective on the world. Because geographers research issues such as sustainable development, gender equity, and environmental change, geography provides tools not only to understand the world but also to change it!
Geography is easy to pair with another major, such as international relations or biology, or a degree from another college, such as the Newhouse School of Public Communications or Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science. After graduation, geography students find jobs in emergency management, federal and state environmental agencies, GIS and cartography, urban planning, non-profit organizations, community and international development, teaching and research, journalism, real-estate analysis, environmental consulting, and other fields. The Geography Department also offers research opportunities for undergraduates. Our majors work with community groups to address concerns like hunger, and public transportation. They complete senior theses on topics from political change in East Africa to water management in Central America. Finally, majors can take advantage of internships or study-abroad opportunities to obtain course credits while gaining valuable work and international experience.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.

Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Explore and critically reflect on geographic issues, concepts, and debates
2. Identify, locate, evaluate, use, and share information as it pertains to geography
3. Articulate what a geographic perspective brings to our understandings of a changing world and its human and environmental dynamics
4. Describe and explain the changing relationship between humans and the environment and its different form over time and across space
5. Describe and explain features of the physical environment, including patterns and causal processes, and variations over time and across space
6. Describe and explain the dynamic relationship between people and places, and among places, over time and across space and scales
7. Develop and apply basic geographic skills and methods using spatial information, such as map making and map reading, spatial analysis and visualization, and quantitative and qualitative analysis

Geography Minor

Program Director:Robert Wilson, Director of Undergraduate Studies
533 Eggers Hall
315-443-2605
Geographers are concerned with social, spatial, and environmental processes in human and natural systems. Their work focuses on critical theory, practical application, analysis, and interventions. Of central importance to the study of geography are relations between social groups, as well as between people and their natural and human-built environments. Coursework for a Geography minor spans the social and natural sciences and includes cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and other technologies for analyzing spatial information. Many geography students combine majors and minors in other fields to prepare themselves for careers in environmental analysis and resource management, urban and regional development, international relations, conflict resolution, public service, and more.

Minor in Geography
To complete a minor in geography, students must complete 18 credits in geography courses, of which a minimum of 12 credits must be upper division (i.e. 300-level or above).

The undergraduate BA major in international relations helps students develop the analytic, cultural, and linguistic skills needed to understand contemporary international affairs, to function effectively in a global environment, and to prepare for further academic or professional study and international career opportunities. This multidisciplinary program provides students with tools and approaches from social science disciplines - anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology - to explore current issues in international affairs and to conceptualize global citizenship.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Recognize global political and economic patterns and relationships.
2. Interpret similarities and differences in cultures, norms, and institutions.
3. Apply theoretical and analytical perspectives in two of nine concentrations: Culture, Identities and Citizenship; Global Health and Environment; International Law and Organizations; Human Rights; International Political Economy; International Security and Diplomacy; Migration; Technology and Global Politics; and Regional Studies with options in Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and the Americas.
4. Demonstrate foreign language competency necessary to study or work abroad.
5. Effectively utilize appropriate quantitative or qualitative research tools, analytical techniques, and presentation skills to explain and interpret contemporary issues in international relations.
Major Requirements
Graduation with a Bachelors of Arts degree in international relations requires an overall grade point average of 2.0 or higher in upper-division courses for the major, including a grade of �C� or better for work undertaken to fulfill the senior capstone requirement.
To declare an International Relations major, or to remain in good standing if directly admitted to the program, students must complete one of three introductory courses with a grade of B or better at Syracuse University. The remaining introductory courses must be completed with a passing grade.
Requirements for the major include 36 credits in courses taken for the major, plus fulfillment of the major�s language proficiency requirement (see below). At least 21 credits must be from courses numbered 300 or higher.  The major requirements include:
Required introductory courses
Research methods requirement
Concentration courses
Language proficiency
Senior capstone seminar
Please note that some required courses have prerequisites. Students should meet with an International Relations advisor to plan accordingly and to ensure all prerequisites are met.

Required Introductory Courses (9 credits)
Each major must complete three introductory courses:
PSC 124 - International Relations or
PSC 139 - International Relations (Honors)
AND
ECN 101 - Introductory Microeconomics or
ECN 203 - Economic Ideas and Issues
AND
MAX 132 - Global Community or
ANT 185 - Global Encounters:Comparing World Views & Values Cross-Culturally
Research Methods Requirement
Each student major takes two 3-credit courses in social science research methods, one from each list below. 
Introductory Research Methods Courses
IRP 201 - International Relations Research Methods
MAX 201 - Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences
PSC 202 - Introduction to Political Analysis

Concentration Courses
Each student major takes 9 credits (3 courses) in each of two concentrations chosen from among the following: Culture, Identities and Citizenship; Global Health and Environment; Human Rights; International Law and Organizations; International Political Economy; International Security and Diplomacy; Migration; Technology and Global Politics; and Regional Studies focused on one of the following regions: Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, or The Americas.
Language Proficiency
Each student major must demonstrate proficiency in a contemporary spoken language other than English. If the student selects a regional studies concentration, this language should be spoken in the selected geographic area. This language should be spoken in the geographic area chosen for the student�s region concentration. Proficiency is demonstrated by coursework through at least the level of Course IV (202) taught by the Syracuse University Department of Languages, Literatures, and Linguistics, or the equivalent. We strongly encourage students to continue language study to an advanced level of literacy and fluency.  Students for whom English is a second language must complete coursework through ENL 213.
Senior Capstone Seminar
The remaining 3 credits are fulfilled in an advanced seminar in which the student designs and implements a capstone project. The capstone typically consists of an original research paper, but other models for written work may be considered at the discretion of the IR Program. Each semester a list of approved senior seminar courses is posted on the International Relations Program website, and capstone proposals must be approved by the faculty of the International Relations Program. Students must earn a minimum grade of a �C� in the written work and for the seminar in order to fulfill the capstone requirement. 
Additional Program Opportunities
International relations majors are encouraged to study abroad during their undergraduate program. Syracuse Abroad offers a rich variety of courses that can be applied to the International Relations major requirements.
Participation in the Maxwell-in-Washington Program, a 15-credit seminar and internship program, is open to all majors. For more information on how this program applies to the International Relations major, please contact the International Relations Program office.
Credits for internships in international relations, including internships abroad and IRP 471 - Global Internship in Washington, D.C., may be counted toward the major upon prior approval by the International Relations Program.
Co-curricular activities including the International Relations Learning Community (a residential program for incoming students), the Sigma Iota Rho Honor Society, Model United Nations Club and Team, International Relations Club, invited speaker series, and other events throughout the Maxwell School are available. More information is available on the International Relations website.
The International Relations Program also offers minors in Global Political Economy and Global Security Studies. For more information, please see the Course Catalog listings for these two programs or visit the International Relations website.  
Program faculty will invite majors who meet the eligibility requirements to participate in the Distinction Program. The Distinction Program offers an enhanced research and mentoring experience.  Working closely with a faculty member, Distinction candidates produce a research project of substantially greater depth than the capstone research project required of all international relations majors. In addition, the Distinction Program provides young scholars the skills and support needed to produce a project suitable for presentation at an academic conference or for publication in an undergraduate social science academic journal.  Graduation with Distinction requires a grade of B or higher on the Distinction paper and in the Distinction seminar.

Iroquois Linguistics for Language Learners Certificate

Faculty
Percy Abrams
Description
The Iroquois language family is a group of distinct but closely related languages. Of these languages, six are spoken by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy: Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora. These languages share a common grammatical structure and cultural history. This certificate program will explore the commonalities and differences among the Iroquois languages.
The courses are designed for students and teachers of Iroquois languages, addressing many different needs. They provide an excellent foundation for Iroquois language students, teachers, linguists, anthropologists, and others. These courses will contribute to Iroquois language revitalization efforts and expand knowledge of the Iroquois languages.
The Certificate in Iroquois Linguistics provides a unique opportunity to study the linguistic principles and grammatical features that are unique to the Iroquois languages. This program also offers a unique opportunity to study Iroquois linguistics with rich examples from the six Haudenosaunee (Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy) languages.
Iroquois linguistics entails the study of a number of interacting grammatical systems within the Iroquois languages. The Certificate Iroquois Languages (CIL) sequence of courses will study all of the grammatical systems within the Iroquois Languages. The student will study the grammatical systems that the Iroquois languages have in common as well as the parts of the grammatical system which makes each of the Iroquois languages distinct.
The Iroquois verb is especially complex. It is imperative that someone who is learning or teaching an Iroquois language has a complete understanding of the grammatical systems that are interacting within the verb; to achieve fluency in an Iroquois language requires a full understanding of the grammatical systems. The Native Speakers of the Iroquois Languages acquire the grammatical systems naturally. In Iroquois Linguistics one seeks to model their knowledge.
A student in the Certificate in Iroquois Linguistics will also explore and learn to use the vast scholarly resources which are available to those who learn the linguistic terminology and concepts that are employed within these resources.

Student Learning Outcomes

Faculty
Stefano Giannini, Anne Leone, Lauren Surovi
The major in Italian language, literature, and culture, which leads to a B.A. degree, provides students with a mastery of the language and a broad knowledge of Italian literature and culture. Lower-division courses teach the skills needed to read, write, and speak Italian. After the second year, students are trained to develop an oral and written command of the language. Literature and film studies cover areas of studies from Dante and the Renaissance to modern and contemporary periods.
All students with more than one year of high school Italian are required to take a placement examination (accessible on line via the �my slice� page), given immediately before registration each semester. The requirement applies to all students regardless of class standing or previous study.
Prospective majors should consult the Italian program coordinator as early as possible. Early consultation is particularly important for students with little or no preparation in Italian so they may be sure to satisfy prerequisites and requirements within four years.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Express themselves in the target language on a number of subjects of practical and intellectual relevance. They can engage in conversations on complex ideas (i.e., discussion and analysis of a literary text) and are able to provide a supported argument, including emerging evidence
in support of their points of view.
2. Comprehend a broad range of subjects of practical and intellectual relevance based on the specific vocabulary studied.
3. Comprehend complex texts previously presented and discussed in class (i.e., novels, short stories, essays, newspapers articles), and understand their main ideas and supporting details. They are able to derive meaning from context and linguistic features.
4. Write summaries, descriptions and critical interpretations of complex texts (i.e., on canonical literary works of the Middle Ages and of the Modernity) using different tenses and expressing their points of view.
5. Demonstrate a general knowledge of Italian culture giving examples from literature, art, history, geography, religion, politics, film and music. Students recognize differences in cultural behavior between their own culture and Italian culture.
Study Abroad
Students studying Italian are strongly encouraged to spend a semester or a year abroad. Syracuse University�s program in Florence, Italy, enables students to take fully accredited classes in Italian language and literature, fine arts, history, political science, and a number of electives outside arts and sciences. For students fluent in Italian, placements are available at the Centro per Stranieri at the University of Florence. For further information, contact the Italian program coordinator or Syracuse University Abroad, 106 Walnut Place.
Major Requirements
The major has two tracks. The first option is to pursue a major in Italian language, literature and culture, which consists of ITA 202 plus 24 credits in upper-division courses. Eighteen of the credits in upper-division courses are from courses taught in Italian; 6 of the credits may be in upper-division courses taught in Italian, in English, or in English with assignments in Italian as approved by the program advisor. LIT courses at the 200 level taught in English by faculty in the Italian Program may be substituted for upper-division courses taught in English to satisfy the major requirements.
The second option is to pursue a major in Italian Studies, which consists of ITA202 plus 24 credits in upper-division courses. At least twelve of the credits in upper-division courses are taught in Italian. Of the remaining twelve credits, at least 3 credits must be in LIT 200 or above taught by faculty in the Italian Program, and nine may be in upper-division courses taught in Italian, in English, or in different disciplines while relevant to Italian Studies, as approved by the Program Advisor.

Linguistics is the scientific study of language and is concerned with the following questions (among others): What does knowledge of a language consist in and how is this knowledge acquired and put to use? What are the similarities and differences among languages? How is language represented in the human brain? How does language differ from animal communications systems? How does language function in society? How and why does language change over time? In addition, linguistics is applied in the teaching of languages and in education generally, in computer programming, in advertising, and in many other areas of study and activity in which language plays a central role.

  Committed to the integration of theory and practice through university-school partnerships and extensive field-based experiences for all students, the mathematics education major engages students in both the conceptual understanding and procedural fluency of mathematics, while also preparing them to teach and instruct math skills in the classroom.
The mathematics education program at Syracuse University is a dual program between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences, in which students earn one degree with a major from each school/college.  In courses and field experiences, students learn how to address all learners� needs in a changing and diverse society, with particular emphasis on mathematics content knowledge, inclusive and culturally relevant pedagogy, critical reflection and explanation of practice, assessment of student learning and development of mathematical literacy, and professional conduct and collaboration. 
Syracuse University offers both a Bachelor�s of Arts (B.A.) and a Bachelor�s of Science (B.S.) option for a mathematics education diploma.  For the B.A. option, please visit the B.A. mathematics education page. The B.S. option requires students to complete more mathematics courses than the B.A. option.
In the B.S. program, students earn a B.S. degree with two majors in both mathematics and mathematics education, and complete courses in three major areas:
Liberal Arts Core and electives
Mathematics major in the College of Arts and Sciences
Professional education courses (including student teaching)
When planning their sequence of courses, students should keep in mind that at least 9 credits of education including student teaching are required in the fall of the senior year in order to meet the prerequisites for the spring student teaching experience. As many content (mathematics major) courses as possible should be completed by the end of the junior year.
A total of 124 credits is required. Some students may need to complete total program credits that are slightly greater than 124.

5) Distinction in Music History and Cultures
(3 credits, required only for students earning a degree with distinction). Majors who have earned a cumulative GPA of at least 3.7 will be invited to earn a degree with distinction. In order to earn this honor, students are required to enroll in HOM 496. These students will work independently, under the supervision of a faculty member, to complete a large-scale project in some aspect of music history or cultures. Students will determine the topic for their Distinction Project in consultation with a thesis advisor, whom they will choose from among the Music History and Cultures faculty (in exceptional cases other faculty may serve in this capacity). The thesis will also be evaluated by a second reader, chosen by the thesis advisor (in consultation with the student) from other faculty in Music History and Cultures or related disciplines. In most cases, the project will take the form of a formal essay approximately 6000 words in length. Alternative types of projects are also possible, provided that they meet with the approval of the Music History and Cultures faculty. Regardless of the topic, the project should constitute original work, serving as a persuasive demonstration of the student�s skills and talents as well as a vivid component of the student�s credentials.

Professionals in technically demanding fields are commonly asked to apply their expertise to other seemingly unrelated disciplines. As a result, they must have a comprehensive understanding of not only their own field, but also secondary knowledge of another broadly based, often interdisciplinary, field of study. A chemist might lend his or her expertise to a matter of legal or ethical importance. A curator might evaluate scientific and historical evidence about a painting�s authenticity. A journalist might research a story involving science, medicine, and technology.
Integrated Learning Majors provide broad, interdisciplinary opportunities for students through valuable tools and knowledge in a variety of fields. This synergistic approach adds scholarly mettle to both the major and the interdisciplinary program, while exploiting their connective properties. For example, an undergraduate interested in chemistry could have an integrated learning program in forensic science. Or a student pursuing archeology could have an integrated learning major in ethics, with focus on social science research.
The integrated learning major in Neuroscience can be combined with majors in: Biochemistry, Biology, Biotechnology, Chemistry, Communication Sciences & Disorders (CSD), Computer Science, Linguistics, Nutrition, Philosophy, Physics, Psychology, Public Health, and two majors in Engineering and Computer Sciences (Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering). The ILM in Neuroscience may also be combined with other primary majors with approval of the Neuroscience ILM director.
This ILM may be combined with any other undergraduate major with approval by the program director. While certain majors typically serve as the base major for this ILM, students are encouraged to meet with the program director to determine their best choice of a base major. Dually enrolled students must have a base major within Arts and Sciences|Maxwell.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Identify cellular components of the nervous system.
2. Identify the location and function of the major structures of the brain.

Description
Using reason and argument, philosophers seek to answer the most fundamental of questions: What am I? What can I know? What must I do? Because the study of philosophy so effectively sharpens and extends the mind, many students find it to be the ideal companion to other courses of study.
The philosophy curriculum has two principal divisions. The first division consists of studies that are central to philosophy proper. There are four core areas: ethics, logic, metaphysics and the theory of knowledge, and the history of philosophy. The second division includes courses devoted to the philosophical examination of other areas of inquiry and culture, such as mathematics, the natural and social sciences, language, politics and the law, the arts, history, education, and religion.
Students particularly interested in political philosophy should see the program description under that heading here.
Students particularly interested in logic should see the description of the logic concentration, included under �Interdisciplinary Minors� in this section of the catalog.

The major introduces students to historical, social, economic, and political factors shaping contemporary public policy issues. Students develop an expertise in a public policy area of their choice that provides a broad range of scholarly perspectives.
Students also acquire practical skills by studying policy issues through coursework in the Policy Studies Program, other departments in the Maxwell School and in the College of Arts and Sciences, Sport and Human Dynamics, Management, School of Education, Visual and Performing Arts and Newhouse. Students develop skills in social science research, computer applications, data collection and analysis, written and oral communications, interpersonal relations, planning, management, and problem solving. These skills are needed to obtain desirable entry-level positions in business, government, and the non-profit sector. They also serve as excellent preparation for admission to leading law schools and public, business, and health administration, as well as other graduate programs. The skills are also essential for participating effectively as a citizen in today�s world.
Several of the required major courses involve internships and policy-related field work. An integral part of the policy studies major is the completion of a research project for a government agency or community organization. This study is frequently used by graduates to display their talents to prospective employers and graduate schools. A practicum is also required in which students do applied research. Students complete no less than 6 and as many as 15 credits in community-based coursework.
Students take 70 percent of their coursework in a core that develops basic skills and covers essential concepts. The other 30 percent of coursework is a series of electives chosen by students to fit their policy interests.

Description:
Psychology is the scientific study of behavior. Professional psychologists may be researchers investigating behavior and/or practitioners, applying their knowledge and skills to individual and social problems.
The Psychology Department offers several options for students. These include a Bachelor of Arts major (B.A.), a Bachelor of Science major (B.S.), and a minor. Students planning to pursue a career in which a background in psychology is useful, such as business, communications, or social services, will find the B.A. degree to be an appropriate track. These students are encouraged to pursue experiences through part-time work or internships in their area of interest. Students interested in pursuing professional careers in psychology, social work, or other professional fields such as law will need to attend graduate school and obtain an advanced degree. These students are encouraged to consult with their academic advisor for advice on whether the B.A. or B.S. degree is most appropriate to meet their long-term goals. All students are encouraged to utilize the career resources available in the Department of Psychology, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the University to learn about opportunities and prepare strategies to meet their goals. 
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.

Knowledge of religion is critical in today�s world. The academic study of religion at Syracuse University offers students opportunities to explore religion in cross-cultural and interdisciplinary contexts.
Students who take our courses learn to interpret the dynamics of religious thought, convictions, actions, and expressions. Some of the questions that they engage include: What kind of life is most worth living? How do we understand the nature of the world? How do we relate to ourselves and to others?
Students study religious life and thought from the perspectives of arts, ethics, ethnography, gender, history, literature, mythology, philosophy, political theory, psychology, scriptural studies, social sciences, and theology.
The academic study of religion is not simply a critical undertaking.  It is also often a transforming experience, introducing students to unfamiliar aspects of their own world, and to the religious realities of our global situation.
The Department of Religion has articulated three goals that shape its teaching and its expectations of what students in its courses and programs may expect to gain from this study:
1. to understand better the nature and diversity of religious expressions in the contemporary world and in history, and their power in peoples� personal and collective lives;
2. to think more deeply and critically about religious experience and its modes of expression and forms of interpretation;
3.  to recognize and appreciate the difficulties and possibilities in a disciplined study of religion; and to become aware of a diversity of approaches and methods within that study.
The Department�s student learning outcomes are elaborations of these goals.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.

Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Examine the degree of religious diversity in the world historically and today
2. Appreciate the crucial role religion has played in the course of human history
3. Critically and imaginatively analyze the role of religion in human expression, thought, and social institutions both historically and in the present day
4. Explain a particular religious tradition and/or problem within the study of religion
5. Recognize the difficulties inherent in undertaking a coherent, disciplined study of religion, and be aware of the diversity of perspectives within that study
6.  Communicate effectively both orally and in writing
Major Requirements
Students wishing to obtain a B.A. in Religion must complete 30 credits (10 courses).  Of the 30 credits, 18 credits (6 courses) must be at the 300-level or above.  Up to 12 credits (4 courses) may be at the 100- or 200-level.

Advances in science and technology have revolutionized the way people live. Science teachers from Syracuse University rise to the challenge of helping students learn the processes, skills, and body of scientific knowledge necessary to excel in the increasingly technological world. At Syracuse University, science education students work closely with faculty with the goal of becoming teachers who have strong science content knowledge; who teach using inclusive and culturally relevant practice and who critically reflect and explain their practice; who collaborate with others and exhibit professional conduct; and who are able to assess their students� learning and development of scientific literacy.
Science education offers students four specific programs from which to choose their field of study: science education/biology, science education/chemistry, science education/earth science, science education/physics. In each of these areas, students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. degree, depending on which major requirements are completed in their primary science area. 
In the science education/biology, B.A. option, students earn one B.A. degree with majors in biology and science education/biology, and complete courses in three major areas:
Liberal Arts Core and electives
Biology (B.A.) major in the College of Arts and Sciences
Professional education courses (including student teaching)
When planning their sequence of courses, students should keep in mind that at least 9 credits of education including student teaching are required in the fall of the senior year in order to meet the prerequisites for the spring student teaching experience. As many biology courses as possible should be completed by the end of the junior year.
A total of 124 credits is required. Some students may need to complete total program credits that are slightly greater than 124. The program meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification to teach biology to grades 7-12. Successful completion of certification examinations, an application and a background check are also required for New York State teacher certification.
Students seeking one of the following majors in English, Mathematics, Science Education Biology, Science Education Chemistry, Science Education Earth Science, Science Education Physics, Social Studies Education, and Spanish Education) while dually enrolled in the School of Education and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 124-127 credits, including the Liberal Arts Core requirements, with some specified courses in the content area to be taught.
Admissions
A minimum of a 3.0 grade point average is required for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences and School of Education dual enrollment program. GPA requirements for admission to the candidacy and standard student teaching semesters, and other prerequisites to these semesters, are mentioned below. Intra-University transfer to the School of Education is coordinated through the Office of Academic and Student Services, 111 Waverly Avenue, Suite 230, and a course sequencing plan must be completed with an advisor at the time of application.

In substitution for three of the elective credits, students with at least 24 credits in the Spanish major and with B+ or better average in Spanish courses may prepare a capstone project or do an internship under the supervision of a Spanish Program faculty member following the guidelines of the program, and on a topic approved by the Program.
Study Abroad
To become fluent in the language and to learn about other cultures and people, students are encouraged to study abroad for a semester or a year. Syracuse University�s programs in Madrid, Spain and Santiago de Chile allow students to take fully accredited courses in Spanish language and literature, anthropology, fine arts, history, political science, and public communication. Students should take all of their courses in Spanish. Students choosing Spanish as a major are encouraged to take advantage of the study abroad program in Madrid or Santiago. Through the Dominican Republic Consortium students also have the opportunity to study in the Caribbean. For further information, contact the Spanish program coordinator or Syracuse University Abroad, 106 Walnut Place.
Notes
All students need to take the online placement exam to determine their appropriate level before entering a Spanish course.

Students, including transfers, with credits earned in Spanish, should consult the major advisor of Spanish as early as possible. Early consultation is also important for students with little or no preparation in Spanish so they may be sure to satisfy requirements within four years.

At least 15 credits of SPA coursework must be taken on the Syracuse campus.
No course taken as a PASS/FAIL course counts towards the major.

Women�s and Gender Studies integrates theory and practice with the aim of transforming social relations, representations, knowledges, institutions, and policies. Through interdisciplinary and comparative approaches, students engage in the study of gender intersectionally and transnationally as a means of understanding the complex ways that ideas and practices about gender, past and present, shape the world around us. Issues of justice, social and economic transformation, and women�s agency are central and at each level of study the curriculum emphasizes race, ethnicity, nationality, class, age, sexuality, and different abilities as categories of analysis.

Program Description
The BFA in Arts Education emphasizes diverse creative processes as laboratories for the exploration of the materials and forms through which human beings have historically shaped enduring ideas, negotiated identity, and organized all that we know and value. The Arts Education program provides students with instruction in artistic systems for producing masterfully wrought forms, communicating cultural languages, and instigating social transformations. Students learn the basic skills for building curriculum and leading project-based learning engagements that champion the crucial function of creative practices in society. The program also prepares students by providing a solid ethical foundation, immersion in the principles of inclusion and the advantages of diversity, along with a thorough understanding of STEAM curriculum-making wherein traditional STEM subjects in education are activated by the Arts at the center. Emphasis on socially responsible approaches to artmaking and design, unconventional field placements and partners, and an interdisciplinary approach to the arts in relation to the humanities and sciences are woven throughout the program coursework.
This is a 124-credit degree intended to facilitate the overlap of two VPA academic majors-one rooted in studio production, and the other committed to inspiring and developing creativity in the next generation of artists, designers, communicators, and innovators. Students majoring in Arts Education must take the following requirements, specialized course electives, and are encouraged to study abroad for one semester.

The minor in Disability Studies focuses on disability as a social and cultural phenomenon, identity, social construct, and metaphor. Disability Studies applies social, cultural, historical, legal, philosophical, and humanities perspectives to understanding disability in society. Topics covered in Disability Studies include disability law and policy; the sociology, anthropology, geography, and history of disability; the intersection between disability and race, gender, sexuality, and class; the representation of disability in literature, the media, and popular culture; advocacy and self-advocacy; and assistive technology and accommodations for people with disabilities. The Disability Studies minor does not focus on instructional or clinical approaches to disability, but can complement the studies of students in these programs.
The minor requires 18 credits, with 12 credits in Disability Studies (DSP prefix) courses and 6 credits of approved electives. At least 12 credits must be taken in 300 level or above courses, and a minimum of 15 credits must be taken through Syracuse University. Courses must be approved by the student�s advisor in Disability Studies.

The education studies minor provides useful skills and experiences for students not enrolled in the School of Education, who go on to pursue careers in communication, business, science, or the arts. The minor in education is purposely broad in scope to allow students to accomplish any and all of the following objectives: (1) to explore education as a professional field of study, (2) to learn about issues in and the practice of education, (3) to prepare for graduate programs in education and related professional fields, and (4) to develop experience in direct work with children and adults through education and counseling.
The minor alone does not provide teacher certification. Students who want to complete prerequisites that will help them more expeditiously complete a master�s degree in teaching, counseling, instructional development, or other related education fields should consult with a faculty advisor in education about their career plans. Students interested in teacher certification through an SU undergraduate program must enroll in one of the teaching preparation programs offered by the School of Education (in some cases as a dual program with another SU college).
Course selection for the minor should be done in consultation with the minor advisor. The minor will consist of 18 credits, including general courses in education and several that are focused on a particular area of education. At least 12 credits must be 300 level or above.
A 2.5 grade point average is required for admittance to the minor.

The general health and exercise science track prepares students for careers in community health and fitness, corporate fitness, clinical physiology, research, medicine, sports medicine and others.
The pre-physical therapy track allows students the opportunity to interchange some courses in order to meet the requirements of graduate study in physical therapy (DPT) while still leaving options open to the other possible career paths listed above.
The third track, the 3+3 program with SUNY Upstate Medical University, allows students the opportunity to spend three years in our health and exercise science program focusing on physical therapy preparation, and then continue with three years in the Doctorate of Physical Therapy (DPT) program at SUNY Upstate. Students transfer the first year of credits taken from SUNY Upstate to SU, which then completes their fourth year at SU and grants them a B.S. degree in health and exercise science. Please note that this track has specific admissions requirements, described in more detail below.  It is not an option available to current SU students or students transferring to SU from another college or university.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Synthesize principles from the natural sciences, including the life-sciences, chemistry, and mathematics, to Health and Exercise Science.

Syracuse University�s Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Health and Physical Education meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification, in both Health AND Physical Education, therefore providing graduates with two New York State teaching certifications (all grades in Health Education and all grades in Physical Education) as well as teacher certification in states with reciprocal agreements. The New York Physical Education certification also qualifies teacher candidates to coach any sport in any school (7-12) in the state of New York.
The degree program emphasizes teaching methods that encourage all children to embrace a physically active and healthy lifestyle with a focus on urban and inclusive settings. The unique location of Syracuse University and the diversity of the surrounding community provide numerous authentic field experiences in urban and suburban settings alike starting in the first year. The School of Education affords its teacher candidates the advantages of resources found only at a major research university, and are enhanced with a strong liberal arts core. Our small class sizes allow teacher candidates to develop strong, personal relationships with their professors, advisors, and peers.
Teacher candidates spend a minimum of 25 hours in the public schools each academic year, culminating with full time student teaching experiences in both health education and physical education in private and public school settings, meeting the time requirements for both as mandated by the NYSED.
The Dual Certification in Health and Physical Education will require a minimum of 136 credits hours and requires teacher candidates to attain a 3.0 GPA by senior year student teaching. Student teaching requirements also include successful completion of the Child Health and Life Safety Seminar and CPR/AED and First Aid certification.

Description
This B.S. degree program is a dual program between the School of Education and the David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics - with the School of Education as the home school. This program meets the academic requirements for New York State teacher certification in both Early Childhood (birth - grade 2) and Students with Disabilities (birth - grade 2).  It seeks to prepare students to make a difference in the lives of children through a strong inclusive education and social justice philosophy and teaching skills, and solid knowledge of the core subjects to be taught and how to teach them.  A cornerstone of the program is the extensive and varied series of field experiences it offers, coordinating coursework with fieldwork in the schools as early as the first year of study. Many schools and childcare centers in the Syracuse area are at the forefront of inclusive education. Through our close partnerships with local schools and early childhood centers that welcome all students, and with our wide network of urban, suburban, and rural school affiliations, we provide a broad range of opportunities for getting the most out of field experiences.

Committed to the integration of theory and practice through university-school partnerships and extensive field-based experiences for all students, the mathematics education major engages students in both the conceptual understanding and procedural fluency of mathematics, while also preparing them to teach and instruct math skills in the classroom.
The mathematics education program at Syracuse University is a dual program between the School of Education and the College of Arts and Sciences, in which students earn one degree with a major from each school/college.  In courses and field experiences, students learn how to address all learners� needs in a changing and diverse society, with particular emphasis on mathematics content knowledge, inclusive and culturally relevant pedagogy, critical reflection and explanation of practice, assessment of student learning and development of mathematical literacy, and professional conduct and collaboration. 
Syracuse University offers both a Bachelor�s of Arts (B.A.) and a Bachelor�s of Science (B.S.) option for a mathematics education diploma.  For the B.A. option, please visit the B.A. mathematics education page.  The B.S. option requires students to complete more mathematics courses than the B.A. option.
In the B.S. program, students earn a B.S. degree with two majors in both mathematics and mathematics education, and complete courses in three major areas:
Liberal Arts Core and electives
Mathematics major in the College of Arts and Sciences
Professional education courses (including student teaching)
When planning their sequence of courses, students should keep in mind that at least 9 credits of education including student teaching are required in the fall of the senior year in order to meet the prerequisites for the spring student teaching experience. As many content (mathematics major) courses as possible should be completed by the end of the junior year.
A total of 124 credits is required. Some students may need to complete total program credits that are slightly greater than 124. The program meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification to teach Math to grades 7-12. Successful completion of certification examinations, an application and a background check are also required for New York State teacher certification.
Admissions
A minimum of a 3.0 grade point average is required for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences and School of Education dual enrollment program.

Description
The music education program, which leads to a Bachelor or Music degree, is designed to give students a strong foundation in musical and teaching skills and to enable them to obtain initial certification for public school teaching (all grades) in New York State and other states with which there are reciprocal arrangements.
Music education students are dually enrolled in the Setnor School of Music and the School of Education. They may elect one of five emphases: brass, choral/general, woodwind, percussion, or strings. By graduation, students are expected to have achieved competencies in all the musical disciplines (e.g., principal and secondary performance areas, music history and theory, sight-singing and dictation, conducting, and ensemble participation) in addition to teaching competencies in such areas as classroom management techniques, music technology, and curriculum development skills. Students must have achieved a 3.0 average in music and education courses, with an overall GPA of at least 3.0 before being permitted to enter into the upper division sequence (junior year) and to student teach (senior year). Students also have opportunities to develop techniques of teaching general music as well as techniques for directing performance ensembles. Our students are also committed to inclusion, anti-racist pedagogy, and equity in the music classroom.
In addition to writing courses, academic credits are required in the following: 6 credits of social science (psychology or sociology), 3 credits in mathematics, 3 credits in the sciences, and 3 credits of multicultural humanities. One course (minimum 3 credits) in a language other than English (including American Sign Language), or equivalent competency established by examination or level three of high school study is also required. If requirement has already been met in high school or by examination, one 3-credit liberal arts elective must be taken in its place.

Syracuse University�s nationally accredited Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Physical Education meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification for all grades, and teacher certification in states with reciprocal agreements. The New York Physical Education certification also qualifies teacher candidates to coach any sport (7-12) in any school in the state of New York.
The degree program emphasizes teaching methods that encourage all children to embrace a physically active lifestyle with a focus on urban and inclusive settings. The unique location of Syracuse University and the diversity of the surrounding community provide numerous authentic field experiences in urban and suburban settings alike starting in the first year. The School of Education affords its teacher candidates the advantages of resources found only at a major research university, and are enhanced with a strong liberal arts core.  Our small class sizes allow teacher candidates to develop strong, personal relationships with their professors, advisors, and peers.
Teacher candidates spend a minimum of 25 hours in the public schools each academic year, culminating with a full-time student teaching semester during which student teachers develop and teach several units of instruction and become involved with the school community. At a minimum, the B.S. in Physical Education can be earned with the satisfactory completion of 120 credits.
The B.S. in Physical Education requires teacher candidates to attain a 3.0 GPA prior to senior year student teaching. Student teaching requirements also include successful completion of the Child Health and Life Safety Seminar and CPR/AED and First Aid certifications.

  Advances in science and technology have revolutionized the way people live. Science teachers from Syracuse University rise to the challenge of helping students learn the processes, skills, and body of scientific knowledge necessary to excel in the increasingly technological world. At Syracuse University, science education students work closely with faculty with the goal of becoming teachers who have strong science content knowledge; who teach using inclusive and culturally relevant practice and who critically reflect and explain their practice; who collaborate with others and exhibit professional conduct; and who are able to assess their students� learning and development of scientific literacy.
Science education offers students four specific programs from which to choose their field of study: science education/biology, science education/chemistry, science education/earth science, science education/physics. In each of these areas, students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. degree, depending on which major requirements are completed in their primary science area. 
In the science education/biology, B.A. option, students earn one B.A. degree with majors in biology and science education/biology, and complete courses in three major areas:
Liberal Arts Core and electives
Biology (B.A.) major in the College of Arts and Sciences
Professional education courses (including student teaching)
When planning their sequence of courses, students should keep in mind that at least 9 credits of education including student teaching are required in the fall of the senior year in order to meet the prerequisites for the spring student teaching experience. As many biology courses as possible should be completed by the end of the junior year.
A total of 124 credits is required. Some students may need to complete total program credits that are slightly greater than 124. The program meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification to teach biology to grades 7-12. Successful completion of certification examinations, an application and a background check are also required for New York State teacher certification.

Advances in science and technology have revolutionized the way people live. Science teachers from Syracuse University rise to the challenge of helping students learn the processes, skills, and body of scientific knowledge necessary to excel in the increasingly technological world. At Syracuse University, science education students work closely with faculty with the goal of becoming teachers who have strong science content knowledge; who teach using inclusive and culturally relevant practice and who critically reflect and explain their practice; who collaborate with others and exhibit professional conduct; and who are able to assess their students� learning and development of scientific literacy.
Science education offers students four specific programs from which to choose their field of study: science education/biology, science education/chemistry, science education/earth science, science education/physics. In each of these areas, students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. degree, depending on which major requirements are completed in their primary science area. 
In the science education/chemistry, B.A. option, students earn one B.A. degree with majors in chemistry and science education/chemistry, and complete courses in three major areas:
Liberal Arts Core and electives
Chemistry (B.A.) major in the College of Arts and Sciences
Professional education courses (including student teaching)
When planning their sequence of courses, students should keep in mind that at least 9 credits of education including student teaching are required in the fall of the senior year in order to meet the prerequisites for the spring student teaching experience. As many chemistry courses as possible should be completed by the end of the junior year.
A total of 124 credits is required. Some students may need to complete total program credits that are slightly greater than 124. The program meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification to teach chemistry to grades 7-12. Successful completion of certification examinations, an application and a background check are also required for New York State teacher certification.

  Advances in science and technology have revolutionized the way people live. Science teachers from Syracuse University rise to the challenge of helping students learn the processes, skills, and body of scientific knowledge necessary to excel in the increasingly technological world. At Syracuse University, science education students work closely with faculty with the goal of becoming teachers who have strong science content knowledge; who teach using inclusive and culturally relevant practice and who critically reflect and explain their practice; who collaborate with others and exhibit professional conduct; and who are able to assess their students� learning and development of scientific literacy.
Science education offers students four specific programs from which to choose their field of study: science education/biology, science education/chemistry, science education/earth science, science education/physics. In each of these areas, students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. degree, depending on which major requirements are completed in their primary science area. 
In the science education/physics, B.S. option, students earn one B.S. degree with majors in physics and science education/physics, and complete courses in three major areas:
Liberal Arts Core and electives
Physics (B.S.) major in the College of Arts and Sciences
Professional education courses (including student teaching)
When planning their sequence of courses, students should keep in mind that at least 9 credits of education including student teaching are required in the fall of the senior year in order to meet the prerequisites for the spring student teaching experience. As many physics courses as possible should be completed by the end of the junior year.
A total of 124 credits is required. Some students may need to complete total program credits that are slightly greater than 124. The program meets the academic requirements for New York State initial certification to teach physics to grades 7-12. Successful completion of certification examinations, an application and a background check are also required for New York State teacher certification.

Total Credits: 122 minimum
Special Opportunities: Fast Track Programs
Selected Studies students have opportunities to take appropriate coursework that will either meet prerequisites to our School of Education master�s degree programs, or reduce the number of credits needed in the master�s program.
Some master�s degree programs (e.g., initial teacher preparation programs) have particular undergraduate liberal arts or other course requirements that, through coordinated advising, can be included in the Selected Studies program. Early contact with the program of interest in advised.
Full-time Selected Studies students may also consider the second option (referred to as the fast track option) - taking courses for graduate credit in the senior year in order to reduce the number of credits needed for the master�s degree as a graduate student. To be eligible for this option, Selected Studies students must:
have a 3.0 GPA or above and
have room in their last two semesters to take graduate courses
Advisors work closely with students to develop a plan of study that will allow them to complete the majority of the undergraduate requirements prior to the senior year, allowing room for graduate courses in the senior year.
One of the primary benefits of this option is that students save time and tuition costs in two ways:
The ability to apply their undergraduate financial aid package toward graduate credits during their senior year.
Eligible to take advantage of School of Education scholarships in place at the time they matriculate in the master�s degree program.  
Currently, formalized fast track options exist with three School of Education departments:
M.S. in Instructional Design, Development, and Evaluation
M.S. in Cultural Foundations of Education
Professional Counseling: M.S. in Clinical Mental Health Counseling; or  M.S. in Professional School Counseling
Fast Track to Instructional Design Development and Evaluation
This dynamic program is best suited for full-time students interested in careers related to instruction and learning outside of the K-12 context. There continues to be a growing demand for instructional designers who are prepared to create educational materials for children through adult populations using a variety of delivery platforms from face-to-face instruction to e-learning. Professionals in this career path may work in business and industry, government and military, healthcare, not-for-profit, museums, Parks and Recreations, higher education, and a variety of other contexts around the world!
Students who maintain at least a 3.0 GPA are eligible to apply for the MS IDD&E program during their junior year.
Admitted students, with advisor approval, will take a selection of 12-15 graduate credits toward their Master�s degree during their senior year. Upon bachelor�s degree graduation, students then matriculate into the MS IDD&E degree program and complete the final 15-18 graduate credit hours in the next year. By successfully completing a majority of credits and producing a professional portfolio, students may be able to complete campus-based activities by December.
Fast Track to Cultural Foundations of Education
This individually designed program fosters and supports fundamental inquiry into the nature of education.  Students draw on history, philosophy, sociology and other disciplines to analyze such issues in education as inequality, disability, popular culture, mass media, the philosophy of multiculturalism and racism.  One of the major objectives of Cultural Foundations of Education is to teach students how to bring the critical analytical tools of a foundational approach to issues in education. Such an approach delves into the assumptions and values that lie beneath our taken for granted understanding of education. 
Selected Studies in Education students may apply from any of the undergraduate focus areas, although coordinated advising will help with undergraduate course selections. 
Admitted students, with advisor approval, will be able to take up to 12 graduate credits toward their Master�s degree during their senior year. Upon bachelor�s degree graduation, students then matriculate into the master�s degree program and complete the final 18 graduate credit hours in the next year.
Fast Track to Professional Counseling
This track is designed for highly motivated and focused students interested in pursuing a master�s degree in clinical mental health counseling or professional school counseling upon completion of their undergraduate degree in Selected Studies in Education, following the �post-secondary and human services fields� track. Students in this track who maintain at least a 3.0 GPA  are eligible to apply for one of the master�s degree programs during their junior year:
Admitted students, with advisor approval, will be able to take up to 18 graduate credits toward their master�s degree during their senior year. Admitted students will matriculate into the master�s degree program the fall semester following completion of their undergraduate degree.

The mission of the aerospace engineering program at Syracuse University is to educate and to promote learning and discovery in aerospace engineering and to prepare students for a career of technical excellence and professional growth and leadership in a complex and competitive technological environment.
The program educational objectives of the aerospace engineering curriculum are to enable graduates of the program to do the following:
apply the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences to professional practice or to advanced study in aerospace engineering or related fields;
be cognizant of societal context and ethical responsibility in professional practice;
function productively on teams and communicate ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences; and
be agile, innovative, and adaptable in an increasingly diverse and global environment.
Opportunities for aerospace engineers will continue to expand within the military, civilian, and general aviation sectors spurred on by the development of new aircraft that extends to civilian supersonic aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. This growth in aircraft demand (as well as the need for higher efficiencies, longer ranges, and lower cost aircraft) is being fueled by the increasing global demand for air travel in the international marketplace. Space exploration has also entered a period of increased activity, both in governmental and commercial organizations that includes an increased exploitation of satellites to service the demand for global communication, the need for low-cost assured access to space, the international space station, and planetary missions.
We prepare our students for this changing environment by providing an opportunity to gain marketable and relevant skills that can lead to success in a wide range of careers. The distinctive signature of undergraduate aerospace engineering at Syracuse University is the ability to fit a minor into the curriculum.
The technical focus of the B.S. program in aerospace engineering (AEE) is to develop a sound educational basis for the analysis and design of aerospace systems, with emphasis on the structure, aerodynamics, flight/orbital mechanics, and propulsion of aircraft and spacecraft systems. Aerospace engineering is a field constantly pushing the limits of technology. The B.S. AEE program stresses the fundamental physical, mathematical, and engineering principles that form the broadest base for future work in a fast-changing field.
The B.S. AEE program is designed to prepare graduates for either immediate employment or for continuing studies at the graduate level. One distinguishing feature of the program is the opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in current research projects, which provide first-hand exposure both to advanced topics of current interest and to challenges typical of graduate school or industrial research. Research experiences for undergraduates are available in many areas, including fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, solid mechanics, and applications of high-performance computers.
Requirements for the B.S. AEE program appear below. For the first five semesters the recommended sequence of courses for the B.S. AEE program is nearly identical to the recommended program for the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering (MEE), which demonstrates the similarity and complementary nature of the two disciplines. Courses carrying the prefix MAE indicate class material and assignments are drawn from both aerospace and mechanical engineering applications. Beginning in the sixth semester, students in the B.S. AEE program begin taking courses addressing topics unique to aerospace engineering, including aerodynamics, aircraft structures, propulsion systems, and the dynamics of aerospace vehicles.
Experience with open-ended design problems is obtained in a sequence of courses that span the entire curriculum. The sequence begins with introductory design experience in the first-year courses ECS 101 and the second-year course MAE 284.  Upper-division courses involving design content include classes on aerospace structures AEE 471, aerospace vehicle dynamics, AEE 427, aerodynamics AEE 332, and propulsion AEE 446. The design sequence culminates with the cap-stone design experience (AEE 472) that requires students to integrate knowledge from all areas in the design of a complete aircraft or spacecraft system.
Topics relevant to the analysis and design of space vehicles are included in AEE 446, AEE 471, and AEE 577.
The B.S. AEE curriculum allows for programs of study that can be tailored by students to take advantage of the diversity of strengths across both ECS and all of Syracuse University. We provide engineering students with opportunities to complete minors in areas that can complement technical knowledge-such as international affairs, business, and public policy-thus enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Syracuse engineering education. Students can also elect to pursue a technical minor or take a distribution of electives, which will include liberal arts classes, free electives, and additional depth in aerospace engineering.
Students are encouraged to develop a plan for elective selection during their first year. The planning process should include discussions with the student�s academic advisor, other faculty members, and peer advisors. The MAE Department offers most undergraduate technical elective courses on a two-year cycle. It may be necessary for a student to modify the sequence of courses to accommodate a technical elective course of personal interest.
In addition to successfully completing the requirements for the aerospace program, graduates from this program must also achieve the following student outcomes:

Student Learning Outcomes
An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics.
An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors.
An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
An ability to recognize the ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgements, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts.
An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives.
An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgement to draw conclusions.
An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies.
An ability to apply knowledge of aerodynamics, structures, propulsion, flight mechanics and orbital mechanics in the analysis of aerospace vehicles.
This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
B.S. AEE Program
There are a total of 24 elective credits in the B.S. AEE program. These credits may be distributed in one of the following two ways:
A student may complete any University minor or a second major that requires at least 12 credit hours beyond the core AEE curriculum. In addition to, or as part of, this minor or second major, at least 9 credit hours must be taken from the social sciences or humanities (SS/H). Excluding those courses that count towards the minor or second major, a maximum of 6 credit hours that are neither SS/H nor technical electives may be taken as part of the 24 elective credits.
A student who does not complete a University minor or second major must take at least 9 credits from the social sciences or humanities (SS/H), at least 6 credits of technical electives, and a maximum of 6 credit hours that are neither SS/H nor technical electives.
Technical electives consist of all 300 level and above courses offered by any department within the college of engineering and computer science or by the math or physics departments, except for ECS 391, ECS 392 and any course numbered 300, 400 or 500 that is offered outside of the MAE Department. However, in some instances these courses may be approved by petition. In addition, no more than 3 credit hours of technical electives may be taken outside of the MAE department.
Many technical electives in the MAE Department are scheduled on a 2-year rotation, so students should make themselves aware of technical elective offerings starting in their third year.
The elective credits that are neither SS/H nor technical electives can be comprised of credits taken from any of the following: (1) courses taken for a letter grade, (2) courses at either 300-level or greater, and/or (3) courses offered by the physical education department.
Social Science or Humanities (SS/H) courses are to be taken from the �Humanities List,� the �Social Science List,� or any foreign language course.
The IDEA course is to be selected from the �IDEA list.�

The mission of the Department of Biomedical and Chemical Engineering is to provide our students with mentoring, curricular experience and extracurricular opportunities consistent with their individual career objectives in order to:
Prepare them to apply science, mathematics and engineering knowledge to serve the needs of society;
Instill in them a deep sense of respect for others and a strong foundation in professional and social ethics;
Develop in them the understanding that continued education will further their professional and leadership skills.
The educational objectives of the program seek to ensure that:
Graduates of the program will have mastered the chemical engineering fundamentals necessary to serve as practicing engineers and will be prepared for further studies in engineering, science, or other professions. These fundamentals include an understanding of basic engineering concepts, the collection of information from experimentation and from the scientific and technical literature, and the prediction of system behavior through the development and application of mathematical models;
Graduates will be able to apply critical thinking, problem solving, and teamwork skills to the design of chemical engineering processes and the solution of scientific and technical problems;
Graduates will be able to effectively communicate their work and ideas through written, oral, and visual formats and they will understand the impacts of their actions and responsibilities to society.
Chemical engineering has a rich past; chemical engineers are the large scale manufacture of numerous products including chemicals, fibers, foods, fuels, pharmaceuticals, plastics, pulp and paper, and rubber. Because chemical engineering is the most versatile of the engineering disciplines, chemical engineers in the future will contribute to diverse new and emerging technologies. They will seek new ways to process our energy and natural resources; they will play key roles in the areas of environmental cleanup and protection, management of hazardous wastes, and process and product safety. They will be involved in new technologies such as biotechnology and biomedicine, and in the development and production of new materials such as polymers, ceramics, and advanced composites.
The chemical engineering curriculum prepares students to apply the fundamentals of chemistry, physics, and engineering to problems related to the efficient and safe production of chemical and related products. The program focuses on developing a solid background in the principles of chemical engineering and their applications to the challenges facing industry and society. If a student wishes to specialize in biochemical, environmental, or polymer materials engineering, he or she can select appropriate science and engineering courses to supplement the general curriculum. Engineering design concepts are integrated throughout all four years of the chemical engineering program.
Beginning with ECS 101 in the fall of the first year, students are introduced to the engineering method for problem solving, and concepts of engineering design. In this way students see how mathematics, basic sciences, and engineering science provide the necessary tools for design and how to go about the design process.
During the sophomore, junior, and senior years, problems of increasing complexity and open-endedness are presented to students in the chemical engineering courses, continually challenging their technical expertise, creativity, and knowledge.
Finally, in their senior year courses, students are required to complete major design projects in their courses and laboratory. These projects are open-ended and designed to build upon the students� understanding and mastery of the fundamentals of mathematics, sciences, and engineering topics. They also consider broader social issues in addition to technical issues such as environmental impact and safety.
Many students take advantage of the low student/faculty ratio by participating in research or independent study projects. There are part-time, summer, co-op, and internship opportunities available for students seeking work experience. International study opportunities are also available.
This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org

Civil Engineering Description
Civil engineering is the broadest of the engineering disciplines, extending across many interrelated technical specialties. These technical specialties include structures, hydraulics, geotechnical, environmental, transportation, construction, and water resources. Civil engineers plan, design, and construct facilities essential to modern life in both the private and the public sectors. These facilities vary widely in nature, size, and scope, and include bridges, buildings, tunnels, highways, transit systems, dams, airports, irrigation projects, facilities for water, collection and treatment facilities for wastewater, and many others.
The first-year curriculum emphasizes the physical and mathematical sciences. Additional courses in mathematics and the sciences, as well as introductory courses in civil engineering are taken during the second year. The last two years of the program focus on planning, design, analysis, and management in civil engineering. The curriculum provides flexibility to allow students to customize their academic programs and take advantage of the diversity across both the college and all of Syracuse University. The four-year program includes coursework in the social sciences and humanities necessary for a well-rounded academic background.
By selecting electives carefully, students may specialize in any of the following areas: structural engineering, which deals with the analysis, design, and rehabilitation of structures under static and dynamic loads; environmental engineering, which involves the purification and distribution of water in cities and the proper disposal of sewage and industrial wastes; geotechnical engineering, which analyzes the properties of soils and rocks that support and affect the behavior of structures, pavements, and underground facilities, and construction engineering which concerns the planning and execution of large-scale construction and infrastructure projects. Students may also complete minors in a variety of subjects.
This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
Adjustments in the program can be made to accommodate transfer students from accredited two- and four-year institutions so they may develop their programs of study as soon as possible after admission.

The mission of the electrical engineering program is to promote learning in electrical engineering through integrated activities in teaching, research, scholarship, creative accomplishments, and service.
The educational objective of the bachelor of science in electrical engineering (BSEE) program in the Department of EECS at Syracuse University is to prepare well-rounded graduates that are ready for work and ready for change.
Well-rounded graduates of the BSEE program are known by their professional competence, innovative thinking, ability to work individually and in diverse teams, leadership abilities, communication skills, and integrity.
Graduates of the BSEE program who are ready for work are engaged in applying the knowledge acquired in their major, combined with their problem solving abilities, to produce feasible solutions to problems, in a timely manner, which are deemed important in industry, government, or academia.
Graduates of the BSEE program who are ready for change exhibit the intellectual flexibility necessary to solve new problems in innovative ways by integrating multiple viewpoints from several disciplines in search of the best possible solutions, or applying their knowledge to different professional disciplines.
Electrical engineering is based on scientific principles governing the motion of charged particles through conductors, semiconductors, or even a vacuum. These phenomena can be harnessed in a variety of applications such as in the treatment of disease, wireless, satellite, and computer communications, power transmission, control of robots, radio and television broadcasting, and development of microelectronics for computers and analog circuits.
This program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
Engineering design is taught in each of the four years of the electrical engineering program. Beginning with ECS 101 in the first year, students are required to formulate solutions to a variety of open-ended laboratory projects. As the students progress through their sophomore and junior years, the projects increase in complexity requiring additional creativity and knowledge. Finally, in the senior year the students are required to complete a major design project that builds upon their mastery of the fundamental concepts of mathematics, basic sciences, the humanities and social sciences, engineering topics, and communication skills.

Student Learning Outcomes
Througouth the undergraduate program in electrical engineering, students will develop:
1. An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics
2. An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors
3. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences
4. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts
5. An ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives
6. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions
7.  An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies
Program Components
The electrical engineering program has five fundamental components: mathematics and sciences, engineering, computing, social sciences and humanities, and general education. Within each component, a number of courses have been set aside as electives in order to allow students, with the guidance of their advisors, to customize their education according to personal and career objectives. A summary of required and elective credits within each component follows:
Mathematics and Science
31 required, 3 elective, 34 total credits;

The mission of the mechanical engineering program at Syracuse University is to educate and promote learning and discovery in mechanical engineering and to prepare students for careers of technical excellence, professional growth, and leadership in a complex and competitive technological environment.
The educational objectives of the mechanical engineering curriculum are to enable graduates of the program to do the following:
apply the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences to professiona or to advanced study in mechanical engineering or related fields;
be cognizant of societal context and ethical responsibility in their profession;
function inclusively and productively on teams and communicate ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences; and
be innovative and adaptable in a diverse and global environment
In order to meet the demands of new and existing high-tech industries, we prepare our students by providing opportunities to gain marketable and relevant skills that can lead to success in a wide range of careers. The distinctive signature of undergraduate mechanical engineering at Syracuse University is its strong technical core coupled with the ability to fit either a technical or a non-technical minor into the curricula. Students explore the breadth of Syracuse University by complementing their mechanical engineering degree with a minor in business, public policy, fine arts, public communications, and many more.
Mechanical engineering is a broad discipline concerned with the design and analysis of systems that produce or modify motion, force, and energy into forms useful to people. Mechanical engineers are employed throughout the complete spectrum of industries, including automotive, industrial machinery, publishing and printing, electrical and thermal power, chemical processing, textile, petroleum, computer and electronic, pharmaceutical, apparel, healthcare, consumer products, soap and cosmetics, paper and wood products, rubber, and glass.
Driven by the breadth of career paths open to mechanical engineering graduates, the B.S. program in mechanical engineering (MEE) is structured to provide a firm educational foundation in the physical, mathematical, and engineering principles and design practices relevant to mechanical and thermal systems. The program is designed to prepare graduates for either immediate employment or for continuing studies at the graduate level.
Requirements for the B.S. MEE program appear below. For the first five semesters the recommended sequence of courses for the B.S. MEE program is very similar to the recommended program for the degree B.S. in aerospace engineering (AEE), which demonstrates the complementary nature of the two disciplines. Courses carrying the prefix MAE indicate that class material and assignments are drawn from both aerospace and mechanical engineering applications.
Beginning in the sixth semester students who follow the B.S. MEE program begin to take courses addressing engineering topics unique to mechanical engineering, including machine design and manufacturing and heat transfer. The last three semesters of the MEE program also include courses of more broad applications, including dynamics of mechanical systems and linear control systems.
Experience with open-ended design problems is obtained in a sequence of courses that span the entire curriculum. The sequence begins with introductory design experiences in the first-year courses ECS 101.
Upper-division courses involving design include courses in machine design and manufacturing, and senior capstone design. The two-semester capstone design experience (MEE 471, MEE 472) requires students to integrate knowledge from all areas in the design of a complete product or system.
The B.S. MEE curriculum allows for programs of study that can be tailored by students to take advantage of the diversity of strengths across both ECS and all of Syracuse University. We provide engineering students with opportunities to complete minors in areas that can complement technical knowledge-such as international affairs, business, and public policy-thus enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Syracuse University engineering education. Students elect to pursue a University minor or take a distribution of electives, which will include liberal arts classes, free electives, and additional depth in mechanical engineering. There are a total of 11 electives or selective elective courses (33 credits) in the B.S. MEE program. The University requires all students to take at least one course (3 credits) in the broad areas of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility (IDEA). The list of approved I.D.E.A. courses can be found in the course catalog. One of the electives (3 credits) must be in economics; which must be either ECN 101, ECN 102, or ECN 203. One of the electives (3 credits) must be in Social Sciences/Humanities (SS/H). One of the electives (3 credits) must be a MAE numerical elective; which must be either MAE 530, MAE 571, or MAE 573. One of the electives must be a MAE analysis elective; which must be either MAE 333 or MAE 312. The remaining 6 courses (18 credits) can be customized for each student in either of two ways:
A University Minor, typically 18 credits coordinated by the offering department. The minor must have fewer than 12 credits of overlap with required MEE courses. A second major also satisfies this option.
A Distribution of Electives, including:
at least 6 credits of SS/H
at least 9 credits of technical electives
one 3-credit free elective
MEE students seeking to complete a Mathematics Minor may take a mathematics course as a free elective but must still complete one of the 2 options listed above.
MEE students seeking to complete the Energy Systems Minor (15 credits) must take an additional 3-credit SS/H course.
Technical Electives are courses at the 300 level or higher taken within the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) Department. Selected courses from other ECS departments, mathematics, or natural sciences may be accepted as technical electives, but no more than 3 credit hours of technical electives can be taken outside the MAE department.
Students may bundle courses into free electives if desired. The bundled courses must be taken for a letter grade, and either be at the 300-level or greater, or be a physical education course. AEW credit cannot be bundled.
Social science or humanities (SS/H) courses are to be selected from any foreign language course, the �Humanities List�, or the �Social Sciences List�, as published in the SU Course Catalog.
To earn a Mechanical Engineering B.S. degree from Syracuse University, students must take 60% of the (26) Engineering and (45) Mechanical Engineering credits, which means that students must take at least 43 credits at Syracuse University. Engineering and Mechanical Engineering credits are courses with the following prefixes: ECS, ELE, MAE, MEE.
Students are strongly encouraged to develop a plan for selections of their electives during their first year. The planning process should include discussions with the student�s academic advisor, other faculty members, and peer advisers. The MAE department offers most undergraduate technical elective courses on a two-year cycle. As a result, it may be necessary for a student to modify the sequence of courses recommended below to accommodate a technical elective course of personal interest.
In addition to successfully completing the requirements for the mechanical engineering program, graduates from this program must also achieve the following student outcomes:

Description:
The 120 credit BS in Food Studies program takes a multi-level and holistic approach to food, from production through consumption. Beyond a core, the curriculum offers required electives in Food Politics, Food Policy, Governance, Community Food Systems and Gastronomy. The major provides excellent preparation for further graduate studies in social science and legal and policy approaches to food. Students with this major might seek employment with government agencies at all levels dealing with food and agriculture issues: food oriented non-governmental organizations that work on sustainability and food security issues; as well as work with food processing, preparation and distribution firms.
  Faculty strengths in international trade and human rights augment local and national policy studies. Our extensive kitchens and a professional staff of chefs, combined with departmental nutrition and public health programs, integrate the new food studies program both in established disciplines and practical experience. The opportunity to pair the food studies major with minors within the Falk College and throughout Syracuse University, such as public health, nutrition, social sciences, policy studies, and communications, offers students unique and marketable complements to their degree program.

Description
This B.S. degree program is a dual program between the School of Education and the David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics - with the School of Education as the home school. This program meets the academic requirements for New York State teacher certification in both Early Childhood (birth - grade 2) and Students with Disabilities (birth - grade 2).  It seeks to prepare students to make a difference in the lives of children through a strong inclusive education and social justice philosophy and teaching skills, and solid knowledge of the core subjects to be taught and how to teach them.  A cornerstone of the program is the extensive and varied series of field experiences it offers, coordinating coursework with fieldwork in the schools as early as the first year of study. Many schools and childcare centers in the Syracuse area are at the forefront of inclusive education. Through our close partnerships with local schools and early childhood centers that welcome all students, and with our wide network of urban, suburban, and rural school affiliations, we provide a broad range of opportunities for getting the most out of field experiences. 
Program Requirements

Description
The undergraduate professional social work program offers a 120 credit Bachelor of Science degree. The goals of this program, in order of priority, are as follows:
To prepare undergraduate students for competent and effective generalist professional practice by developing the requisite social work knowledge, values, and skills, and
To prepare undergraduate students for continuing professional education and/or graduate education.
The social work program is based on the concept of ecological systems, which maintains that the fundamental focus of social work practice is on the transactions of people and their environments, and on the constant state of reciprocity in which each shapes the other. Social work intervention aims to promote the progressive forces and minimize the regressive forces in those transactions. The curriculum incorporates instruction in five professional foundation areas: social welfare policy and services, human behavior in the social environment, research, social work practice, and field practicum. Instruction in these areas builds upon a carefully chosen and strong behavioral sciences, and the natural sciences taken within the College of Arts and Sciences.
  The program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.

Effective management of supply chain is critical for business success in today�s complex, dynamic and globalized environment. A supply chain is a pipeline of material, information and financial flows, frequently global in scope. It includes not only the organization but also the suppliers, buyers, and others with whom it interacts.
Supply chain management requires a distinctive view of business: procurement, manufacturing, and distribution must be viewed and controlled as a seamless flow. Good supply chain managers eliminate delays, reduce the amount of resources tied up all along the chain, and mitigate potential risks that can disrupt operations. To perform effectively, a company must develop policies to ensure the seamless flow and learn to function with its partners like a single organism.
An understanding of supply chain management is an asset to any manager, and there is a strong demand for specialists who can comprehend and manage the entire chain. Building on long-established strengths, the undergraduate major offers a solid grounding in this exciting field.
Students have the opportunity to take various certification exams such as APICS, AST&L and others.

Students who are interested in directing and playwriting may elect to take additional courses in these areas under drama support requirements. All students are required to take coursework in writing.
Although first-year students are not permitted to perform on stage for the public, they work on productions behind the scenes in a wide variety of jobs, ranging from running crews to assistant stage managing. From the second year on, students may audition for roles in: faculty-directed productions and scenes and plays directed by students; films produced by undergraduate and graduate film students; and productions outside the department, including Syracuse Stage productions in appropriate roles or as understudies where union rules permit the use of non-Equity actors. Equity points may be earned through work with Syracuse Stage.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Analyze a wide range of dramatic materials for the purpose of making informed choices in rehearsal about the character, story, and interpretation
2. Demonstrate the ability to listen, follow an impulse, and respond truthfully to a scene partner while making active choices under a specific set of circumstances

Program Description
The BFA in Arts Education emphasizes diverse creative processes as laboratories for the exploration of the materials and forms through which human beings have historically shaped enduring ideas, negotiated identity, and organized all that we know and value. The Arts Education program provides students with instruction in artistic systems for producing masterfully wrought forms, communicating cultural languages, and instigating social transformations. Students learn the basic skills for building curriculum and leading project-based learning engagements that champion the crucial function of creative practices in society. The program also prepares students by providing a solid ethical foundation, immersion in the principles of inclusion and the advantages of diversity, along with a thorough understanding of STEAM curriculum-making wherein traditional STEM subjects in education are activated by the Arts at the center. Emphasis on socially responsible approaches to artmaking and design, unconventional field placements and partners, and an interdisciplinary approach to the arts in relation to the humanities and sciences are woven throughout the program coursework.
This is a 124-credit degree intended to facilitate the overlap of two VPA academic majors-one rooted in studio production, and the other committed to inspiring and developing creativity in the next generation of artists, designers, communicators, and innovators.

Ceramics Minor

Program Director:Contact
Peter Beasecker, Program Coordinator

ComArt Building, 315-443-3700, prbeasec@syr.edu 
Description
The 110-year-old Ceramics Program in Syracuse University�s School of Art and Design is ideally positioned to offer a Minor degree in Ceramics to all undergraduate students of the university. With the combination of three full-time faculty, a technician, extensive facilities and highly qualified graduate students, the Ceramics Program is more than capable to provide a Minor degree.
While candidates for this degree may come from any discipline within the University, the Ceramics Program has a history of attracting students from Architecture, Industrial Design, Geology, Engineering and Business. The Ceramics Program teaches equally to the fine art major, as well as students of craft and to the many architectural and industrial practices that involve ceramic processes. The field of ceramics has direct historical ties with design, engineering, architecture, geology, business and studies in art history. Indirectly the connections broaden to incorporate literature, poetry, philosophy and politics as they pertain to the ceremonies and content that surround ceramic objects and their relevance to cultural identity.
The prospective advantage of minors working alongside majors is very exciting considering the different expertise that students from other majors at the University will bring to their ceramic work and to the content and conversation among the studio arts major population in the Ceramics Program. This has been the experience of the Ceramics Faculty over the years as they have numerous exceptional and engaged students expressing a desire to minor in this exciting and historically rich major.
Students accepted into the Minor will be assigned a faculty advisor from the full-time faculty in the Ceramics Program.
Admission Requirements:
Minimum 3.0 GPA
Must enter by the beginning of Junior Year.

Heath Hanlin, Rebecca Rugie Xu, Sarah Long, Su Hyun Nam
Description
The Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.) degree program in Computer Art and Animation is dedicated to exploring the possibilities of digital media within a fine art, exploratory, and culturally aware setting. Through instruction in 3D computer animation, electronic object creation, code-based art, sound design, and sonic art, students are mentored to become highly skilled critical thinkers producing art in individual and collaborative contexts.
In your first year, you build a strong foundation for working within the digital realm while developing an artistic voice engaged in the language of the medium. During the second year we investigate the diverse possibilities of computer art, the intensity of which is oriented by the inclination of the student and tailored through mentorship. In the third and fourth years, we bring these skills into creative focus, demanding a professional art practice that is both technically sophisticated and critically engaged.
Within the Department of Film and Media Arts, computer art is integrated with film, art video, and art photography, allowing for a practice that is tightly focused but free to traverse a network of related disciplines. This network expands into the rest of Syracuse University, challenging you to further develop the intellectual resources needed to inform your work. Through this process you synthesize a perspective that is shaped within a web of mutual influence and discourse.
Celebrating its 30th year, the computer art program boasts alumni who are placed at some of the most prestigious animation and visual effects companies in the world-Pixar, Rhythm and Hues, Industrial Light and Magic, Lucasarts, Blizzard, Tippett Studios, Motion Picture Company, and Sony Pictures Imageworks-along with creative representation at galleries and media art festivals internationally. The program�s alumni and faculty have consistently pushed the edge publicly as to what it means to be a computer artist and continue to maintain that intensity today.

Description
The  educational mission of our film program is to provide a stimulating and rewarding context for independent filmmaking. We foster creative, intellectual, and personal achievement by providing an exceptional hands-on education from development to post-production: scriptwriting, budgeting, storyboarding, cinematography, directing, sound design and post-production: including 2D and 3D animation.  Students can pursue various modes of filmmaking, from narrative to documentary and experimental.
The film program places equal emphasis on academic film studies, creative production, and interpersonal and leadership skills. The program encourages independence, debate, and originality. Our approach to film is aesthetic rather than a commercial enterprise. All students are required to take film history, theory and criticism classes where they develop conceptual, critical and aesthetic skills that empower them to become the top filmmakers of tomorrow.
First and second year students follow a core curriculum, including introductory production courses and essential filmmaking skills. The third year allows students to dive into specific filmmaking aspects that they are passionate about while the fourth year brings it all together, as students develop their unique voice, style and professional practice in a final thesis film.
In addition, our program offers three culturally immersive, intensive, and professional minded study abroad options in Prague, Bologna and Los Angeles.  On campus students have the opportunity to be involved in the Syracuse International Film Festival and the Syracuse Film Society (a student-run film organization).
Fourth year students have two additional opportunities: the Sundance Ignite program where selected students get an insider view of the film industry by attending multiple public and private events during the festival; and the Bryan Buckley Award which offers finanical support to outstanding thesis projects, both in their production and post-production stages.
The film production facilities include 4K cutting edge digital film cameras, digital RAW-enabled recorders, professional film lenses, Super 16mm analog film cameras, a large array of location lighting including state-of-the-art HMI, Flourescent and LED lights such as Arri M18 HMI, Arri Skypanels, Joker HMI Fresnels, and Kino-Flo Banks, among many others. We also have professional mounting gear, a studio dolly, car mounts and gimbals.
Our non-linear editing facilities are 4K ready, equipped with the Adobe Creative Cloud, Da Vinci Resolve, and other professional software.  Our color grading facilities are equipped with a Flanders Scientific broadcast monitor and professional grading controls. We also have two top-notch sound mixing studios as well as a lighting studio and green screen.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Technical Skills: Demonstrate a subset of technical skills involving process or technique knowledge and proficiency in Film Production
2. Conceptual Skills: Demonstrate a broad set of skills in Film that allow a student to understanding abstract ideas and complicated processes while also think creatively
3. Critical Thinking: Analyze theoretical, critical and historical thoughts and concepts clearly and effectively through film
4. Filmmaking Proficiency: Produce quality films that demonstrate a cohesive and compelling production, appropriate to the medium while effectively managing the resources and logistics to produce a film

Description
Industrial designers develop a wide spectrum of design solutions that meet current demands and anticipate the future needs of society. Their designs must incorporate the effective use of materials and technology, allow for manufacturing constraints, and provide a clear advantage to existing solutions.
The five-year program in industrial and interaction design, which leads to the professional degree, bachelor of industrial design (B.I.D.), is noted for combining theory and practice, taking a process-oriented approach, and focusing on social and environmental responsibility. It is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design and exceeds the educational minimums recommended by the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA). The program consists of courses in design theory and practice, as well as support courses in the humanities, the physical and natural sciences, and the behavioral and social sciences. The responsive curriculum maintains a balance between technical, aesthetic, and humanistic aspects and keeps pace with the leading edge of design technology by anticipating developments in the field.
Students in the program participate in collaborative projects with business, industry, and government agencies, challenging students with real-life design problems. Industrial and interaction design students have an active chapter of the IDSA, which plans lecture programs, organizes field trips to consultant and corporate design offices, and participates in regional and national meetings of the society.

Description
The music education program, which leads to a Bachelor or Music degree, is designed to give students a strong foundation in musical and teaching skills and to enable them to obtain initial certification for public school teaching (all grades) in New York State and other states with which there are reciprocal arrangements.
Music education students are dually enrolled in the Setnor School of Music and the School of Education. They may elect one of five emphases: brass, choral/general, woodwind, percussion, or strings. By graduation, students are expected to have achieved competencies in all the musical disciplines (e.g., principal and secondary performance areas, music history and theory, sight-singing and dictation, conducting, and ensemble participation) in addition to teaching competencies in such areas as classroom management techniques, music technology, and curriculum development skills. Students must have achieved a 3.0 average in music and education courses, with an overall GPA of at least 3.0 before being permitted to enter into the upper division sequence (junior year) and to student teach (senior year). Students also have opportunities to develop techniques of teaching general music as well as techniques for directing performance ensembles. Our students are also committed to inclusion, anti-racist pedagogy, and equity in the music classroom.
In addition to writing courses, academic credits are required in the following: 6 credits of social science (psychology or sociology), 3 credits in mathematics, 3 credits in the sciences, and 3 credits of multicultural humanities. One course (minimum 3 credits) in a language other than English (including American Sign Language), or equivalent competency established by examination or level three of high school study is also required. If requirement has already been met in high school or by examination, one 3-credit liberal arts elective must be taken in its place.

Description
The B.Mus. music industry program prepares students to be competent musicians, and to comprehend, understand and analyze the rapidly changing advances in the industry. Students study and discuss the implications of current trends as they become familiar with the realities of general business and the creative and legal practices of the music business. In classes and through guest lectures and mentoring by leading industry professionals, students learn about professional organizations and their role in the industry.
The program also provides students with unprecedented opportunities to continue their education and broaden their skills and portfolio with graduate degree programs. In partnership with the Whitman School of Management, Setnor now offers the MUI/MBA 5-year dual degree program where B.Mus. music industry students who qualify can stay a 5th year and achieve an MBA. For students who have an interest in arts administration and non-profit music management students can enter into the M.A. in Arts Leadership program. There are also graduate programs in music performance and an M.S. certification in music education.

Description
The purpose of the musical theater program is to train students in a systematic way that prepares them to compete realistically in the complex professional world of musical theater. Achieving this goal requires a carefully structured balance of studio and academic work. Musical theater studio work requires skills not only in dramatic performance, but in music and dance as well. Students develop their skills in a structured, intensive format that features careful and expert guidance.
Performance is a major focus of the 128-credit program. Students gain skills and experience in the various modes of musical theater: the revue, traditional musical comedies, operettas, and new and experimental forms. Coursework includes a balance of acting, voice, dance, theater history, music theory, and liberal education studies.
The first year is the foundation for all future training. It focuses on techniques of acting, ballet, voice-both singing and speaking-sight-singing, music theory, dramatic theory, and technical theater crafts. Writing is also a requirement for all musical theater majors. The first year is a non-performance year, but students are assigned to work on one production behind the scenes. They may elect to work on additional productions in a wide variety of jobs.
After the first year, students may audition for all productions-musicals, dramas, films-i.e., all productions connected with the Department of Drama, Syracuse Stage and the wider University. They also begin specialized training in musical theater performance, scene study, audition techniques, musical theater history, musical theater dance, and choreography. Supplementing these studies are courses in theater history, additional weekly lessons in voice, vocal ensemble experience, piano, and academic electives.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Sing with a flexible voice that can execute the requisite sounds and styles of the MT repertoire, drawing on a wide and diverse heritage of music genres
2. Exhibit technical and stylistic proficiency in the various dance forms of musical theater, drawing on a wide and diverse heritage of dance genres
3. Demonstrate the acting techniques to create and inhabit various characters, including material with which they can personally and artistically identify
4. Apply the acquired skills of analysis, in music and acting, to the preparation of a wide and diverse variety of literature for performance
5. Demonstrate the ability to participate and contribute to collaborative artistic endeavors to a professional standard

Advanced students design many Department of Drama main-stage productions and work with the professional staff and company of Syracuse Stage. Seniors in the program are eligible for internships with Syracuse Stage.
Students interested in design specialize in one or more areas: set design, costume design, and lighting design. Each area of specialization requires a specific sequence of coursework. Courses in studio art, art and architectural history, and costume history contribute to developing conceptual design skills. The theater design and technology program also offers training in the use of computers as design tools. Facilities include two design studios, a Light Box and a CAD lab in addition to the technical shops shared with Syracuse Stage.
B.F.A. students interested in the technical aspects of theater may specialize in scene construction and painting, lighting, properties, or costumes, in consultation with a faculty advisor.
The B.F.A. program is appropriate for students interested in a career in the fields of entertainment design or technology.
Students wishing to explore a curriculum that combines theater design and technology with a broader liberal arts content may apply for the120-credit B.S. degree in drama, with a technical theater emphasis, provided they have been admitted to and have completed a portion of the B.F.A.

Student Learning Outcomes
After four years in the Theater Design and Technology program, students are expected to graduate with a competitive portfolio and resume to submit for consideration for professional employment or for admission to a Master of Fine Arts program in their area of concentration. The following competencies are expected to be gained in the program through classes and experiential learning:
Create a visual interpretation of a script or concept through an understanding of theater as an art form
Communicate effectively and clearly with all collaborators (directors, other designers, performers, technical shops, producers, etc.) on any given project
Respectfully provide and receive feedback of their own work as well as their peers
Demonstrate an understanding of the principles of both two and three-dimensional design, and the use of the elements of design (color, texture, line, form/mass, and light) to affect emotional impact of theatrical design
Apply knowledge of art history into theatrical design
Create freehand drawings of figures, still life scenes and perspective sketches
Create technical drawings - both hand and computer-aided (ground plans, sections, elevations, painter�s elevations, lighting plots, costume sketches) for the fabrication and realization of theatrical designs

Visual Culture Minor

Program Director:Contact
Rachel Hall, Program Coordinator

114 Sims Hall, 315-443-0792, rchall01@syr.edu
Description
The minor in Visual Culture exploits one of the unique strengths of Syracuse University: a world class arts school in the midst of a research institution. The minor is an interdisciplinary program sponsored by the following units: The School of Art and Design and Communication and Rhetorical Studies. The minor functions as an academically-based minor that is intended to complement the studio-based majors in the College of Visual and Performing Arts and provide non-studio based majors a concentration in visual culture and criticism that is theoretically and historically informed. The minor is open to all Syracuse University undergraduates.
The Visual Culture minor provides students with the critical skills necessary to address the evolving intersection of art, design, and communication in a variety of contexts including the art world, consumer culture, politics, and popular culture. Drawing on the diversity of disciplinary approaches to visual culture, the minor fosters critical engagement with diverse modes of visual expression and communication, from advertising design and image activism to material culture and public sculpture.
The Visual Culture minor equips students with an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that will illuminate (1) the diverse sensory modes (i.e. verbal, aural, tactile, etc.) that inform and interact with visual expression; (2) the various institutional frameworks that shape the production, circulation, and reception of visual culture (from the nineteenth century forward); and (3) the historical and cultural contexts that normalize particular viewing practices and social formations.
By the completion of the minor, students will be adept in interdisciplinary viewing practices, familiar with diverse critical approaches to visual meaning, and an effective in communicating complex visual ideas.
The Visual Culture minor should be of interest to students who seek a program that focuses on visual culture as the nexus of creative practice, advocacy, and criticism

Recreation Resource And Protected Area Management - ESF Minor

Program Director:Coordinator: TBD
This minor provides students with the opportunity to combine visitor management with protected area management. Understanding the need to balance the opportunity for visitor experiences with protecting and stewarding protected areas provides professional insight into planning and managing those areas for limited visitor access. Understanding the motivations, preferences, and behavior of recreational users is necessary to integrate the human dimensions into protected area management with consideration of the social and environmental factors related to such management. Protected area managers need to be able to manage both the resource itself as well as a wide variety of users, such as campers, hikers, bird watchers, boaters, nature photographers and others who enjoy nature-based experiences in extensive protected area environments owned by public agencies, private landowners, or NGOs.
Students from all programs at ESF are eligible for this minor if they have completed a general ecology course and have a cumulative grade point average of 2.70 or better in their major program of study after one semester at ESF (or as a transfer student with same standing). Overlap between the minor and both one required course and one directed elective for a student�s major is permitted; other courses taken for the minor can not overlap with the major.
This interdisciplinary minor requires 15 credits and includes the following courses taught at ESF in the Departments of Forest and Natural Resources Management and Environmental and Forest Biology:

Renewable Energy - ESF Minor

Program Director:Coordinator: Dr. Tim Volk
The development of sustainable sources of energy has become a critical national and global issue due to concerns about the quality and quantity of the different potential resources, energy security, and potential impacts of each on the environment and human health. It is essential that our society and energy professionals gain an understanding of production and conversion of different forms of energy, their current and future supplies, the markets and policy mechanisms that regulate their supply, and the associated impacts on the environment for each fuel. In the past both traditional and renewable energy sources have been studied one resource at a time and usually from the perspective of a single discipline. This minor will provide students an opportunity to examine different sources of traditional and renewable energy simultaneously in the context of our total energy use using a systems perspective. Students will be exposed to views from a variety of disciplines as they wrestle with a wide array of issues related to current and future energy supply and use.
The Renewable Energy minor is available to all ESF undergraduate students (except students who are in the Sustainable Energy Management Major or the Renewable Energy option in Environmental Science) who have a GPA of 2.70 or better by the end of their sophomore year. The minor will require a minimum of 15 credits, 12 of which are required courses. The remaining 3 credits can be selected from a list of suggested courses.

Economists analyze the internal functioning of markets and market outcomes. While modern economics focuses on market forces, markets function imperfectly in some cases and that introduces scope for policy action. Our curriculum emphasizes the application of economics to the study of public policy issues and the role of government in a market economy. Examples include analysis of international trade and relations, economic behavior in the workplace, health care, taxation, and numerous other spheres of a global economy. Students who major in economics prepare themselves for a variety of careers. Some move on to graduate study in economics and become professional economists; the majority, however, pursue careers in law, public policy, government, and many aspects of business, including banking and financial analysis, management, and marketing. Consequently, some students choose to pursue double majors and dual degrees. Further information on these programs is available in the Academic Rules and Regulations section of this catalog or in the economics department office.
The department offers both the B.A. degree in economics as well as a STEM-designated B.S. degree in economics. The B.A. has a liberal arts focus and emphasizes the applied and policy aspects of economics. The B.S. is attractive to the more mathematically oriented student.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Correctly define advanced/field specific level economics vocabulary
2. Correctly utilize advanced/field specific level economics vocabulary
3. Effectively identify the applications of advanced/field specific level graphical economic tools and analytic techniques
4. Independently choose and effectively utilize appropriate advanced/field specific level economic graphical analysis to policy analysis
Major Requirements
To Earn a B.A. in Economics
A student becomes an economics major after consulting with an economics advisor on a plan and course of study and bringing them to the department office for approval. To earn a B.A. in economics, a student:
1. Quantitative Skills Requirement
MAT 284 - Business Calculus
Students must earn a grade of C or higher in MAT 284
2. Completes 6 credits of Principles of Economics
(ECN 101 and ECN 102) OR (ECN 101 and ECN 203)
ECN 101 - Introductory Microeconomics
ECN 102 - Introductory Macroeconomics
ECN 203 - Economic Ideas and Issues
3. Completes 21 credits of Upper-division Economics Courses including:
ECN 301 - Intermediate Microeconomics or
ECN 311 - Intermediate Mathematical Microeconomics
ECN 302 - Intermediate Macroeconomics
ECN 422 - Introduction to Statistics and Econometrics
Credit will not be given for both ECN 422 and ECN 521.
Four other upper-division electives in economics
Upper-division electives are ECN 300 or higher, (excluding ECN 301, ECN 302, ECN 303, ECN 311, ECN 365, ECN 422, ECN 470 and ECN 521), including at least two courses that have a prerequisite of:
ECN 301 - Intermediate Microeconomics or
ECN 311 - Intermediate Mathematical Microeconomics or
ECN 302 - Intermediate Macroeconomics
Credit will not be given for both ECN 422 and ECN 521.
Additional Information
In all, 27 credits of economics courses are required.
The Economics Department applies a two-thirds rule to the upper-division economics courses (item 3 above). Two-thirds of the upper-division coursework must be taken at Syracuse University or its affiliate programs, such as SU Abroad. In practical terms, no more than two of the upper division courses may be taken at another college or university and applied to the B.A. economics major at Syracuse University.
Graduation with a B.A. in economics requires an overall grade point average of 2.0 or higher in 21 credits of upper-division economics courses.

Scheduling
It is recommended that students sequence their courses in the following manner:
The Principles of Economics (ECN 101 and ECN 102 or ECN 101 and ECN 203) and the Calculus quantitative skills requirement MAT 284 should be completed by the end of the sophomore year or earlier.
The quantitative skills requirement MAT 284 is a prerequisite for the intermediate theory courses ((ECN 301 or ECN 311) and ECN 302).
The intermediate theory courses ((ECN 301 or ECN 311) and ECN 302) are the prerequisite courses for ECN 422 and many of upper-division electives. For this reason, it is important that students complete their intermediate coursework by no later than the fall of their junior year or earlier.
Students should complete ECN 422 and at least two upper-division electives in economics by the end of their junior year or earlier.
Substitutions
Courses not listed in the above plan and/or taken outside Syracuse University will not be counted toward the fulfillment of economics degree requirements except upon the approval of a petition. Such petitions should be approved before the substitution course is taken, unless it was completed while the student was regularly enrolled in the school or college in which the course was offered. For management students with a second major in economics, FIN 355 may be used as a substitute for ECN 481. Credit is not given for both ECN 481 and FIN 355.
Curriculum Suggestions
Students who are more analytically inclined or interested in graduate school should plan to take MAT 295/MAT 296, and take ECN 311 rather than ECN 301. In addition, they may wish to take ECN 505 and ECN 522 as upper-division economics electives.
Students planning to enter law school after graduation may find ECN 431, ECN 451 and ECN 481 of particular interest, while those who plan to pursue graduate degrees in management may want to choose from ECN 465, ECN 481, and ECN 487. Students pursuing an international specialty might be interested in ECN 410 (Economic Development), ECN 465, and ECN 481. Students preparing a public sector specialty might find ECN 431 of particular interest. Those with a human resources interest should select ECN 451. Those interested in macroeconomic theory should consider ECN 481.
The School of Management allows economics majors to take one course per semester in the School of Management. These courses are counted as general electives and not as economics or arts and sciences electives.

The study of geology provides insights into some of humanity�s deepest questions. How was the planet Earth, our lifeboat in space, formed? What are the processes that have shaped the Earth - its surface and internal structure? How has life, of which humanity is a part, evolved? Why are there earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain chains, continents, and deep oceans? How has the surface and climate of the Earth changed through time? The study of geology is made up of  interdisciplinary fields in the Earth sciences that draw on fundamental knowledge in physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics and provides a basis for understanding natural hazards, climate variability and global change, and exploring for the energy, water and mineral resources upon which society depends. The BS in geology offers a solid foundation for students interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the Earth sciences and/or careers as research scientists in public, corporate, or academic settings.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.

Economists analyze the internal functioning of markets and market outcomes. While modern economics focuses on market forces, markets function imperfectly in some cases and that introduces scope for policy action. Our curriculum emphasizes the application of economics to the study of public policy issues and the role of government in a market economy. Examples include analysis of international trade and relations, economic behavior in the workplace, health care, taxation, and numerous other spheres of a global economy. Students who major in economics prepare themselves for a variety of careers. Some move on to graduate study in economics and become professional economists; the majority, however, pursue careers in law, public policy, government, and many aspects of business, including banking and financial analysis, management, and marketing. Consequently, some students choose to pursue double majors and dual degrees. Further information on these programs is available in the Academic Rules and Regulations section of this catalog or in the economics department office.
The department offers both the B.A. and STEM-designated B.S. degree in economics. The B.A. has a liberal arts focus and emphasizes the applied and policy aspects of economics. The B.S. is attractive to the more mathematically oriented student.
The B.S. degree is STEM-designated and has an orientation toward the statistical and mathematical skills necessary to work as a professional economist or pursue graduate work in economics, public policy, or business. Students who want these career tracks or who want to acquire more analytical skills that can be used in a variety of careers should pursue the B.S. degree.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Correctly define advanced/field specific level economics vocabulary
2. Correctly utilize advanced/field specific level economics vocabulary
3. Effectively identify the applications of advanced/field specific level graphical economic tools and analytic techniques
4. Independently choose and effectively utilize appropriate advanced/field specific level economic graphical analysis to policy analysis
Major Requirements
To Earn a B.S. in Economics
A student becomes an economics major after consulting with an economics advisor on a plan and course of study and bringing them to the department office for approval. To earn a B.S. in economics, a student:
1. Completes calculus courses:
MAT 295 - Calculus I
MAT 296 - Calculus II
Students must achieve a C average in the two calculus courses.
2. Completes 6 credits of Principles of Economics:
(ECN 101 and ECN 102) or (ECN 101 and ECN 203)
ECN 101 - Introductory Microeconomics
ECN 102 - Introductory Macroeconomics
ECN 203 - Economic Ideas and Issues
3. Completes 27 credits of upper-division economics courses, including:
ECN 311 - Intermediate Mathematical Microeconomics (not ECN 301)
ECN 302 - Intermediate Macroeconomics
ECN 505 - Mathematical Economics
ECN 521 - Economic Statistics
ECN 522 - Econometric Methods
Four other Upper-Division Electives in Economics
Upper-division electives in economics  are ECN 300 or higher, (excluding ECN 301, ECN 302, ECN 303, ECN 311, ECN 365, ECN 422 and ECN 470, ECN 505, ECN 521, ECN 522), including at least two courses that have a prerequisite of:
ECN 311 - Intermediate Mathematical Microeconomics
ECN 302 - Intermediate Macroeconomics
ECN 301 - Intermediate Microeconomics
Additional Information
In all, 27 credits of upper-division coursework (courses numbered 300 or higher) in economics are required, in addition to the two courses in calculus, and principles of economics. In some instances, SOM majors will be allowed to substitute MAS 261 and BUA 345 for ECN 521.
The Economics Department applies a two-thirds rule to the upper-division economics courses (item 3 above). Two-thirds of the upper-division coursework must be taken at Syracuse University or its affiliate programs, such as Syracuse Abroad. In practical terms, no more than three of the upper-division courses may be taken at another college or university and applied to B.S. economics major. Because of the specialized nature of ECN 311, ECN 505 and ECN 522, it may be difficult to find acceptable substitutes for these courses at other colleges or universities.
Graduation with a B.S. in Economics requires an overall grade point average of 2.0 or higher in the 27 credits of upper-division economics courses.
Scheduling
It is recommended that students sequence their courses in the following manner:
The Principles of Economics ECN 101 and ECN 102 or ECN 101 and ECN 203 and the two required calculus courses, MAT 295 and MAT 296, should be completed by the end of the sophomore year or earlier, and before taking ECN 311.
ECN 311 and ECN 302 should be taken no later than the fall of the junior year.
ECN 521 and ECN 522 should be taken in the junior year.
Two of the four economics upper-division electives should be taken by the end of the junior year.
Substitutions
Courses not listed in the above plan and/or taken outside Syracuse University will not be counted toward the fulfillment of economics degree requirements except upon the approval of a petition. Such petitions should be approved before the substitution course is taken, unless it was completed while the student was regularly enrolled in the school or college in which the course was offered. For management students with a second major in economics, FIN 355 may be used as a substitute for ECN 481. Credit is not given for both ECN 481 and FIN 355.
Curriculum Suggestions
Students planning to enter law school after graduation may find ECN 431, ECN 451, and ECN 481, of particular interest, while those who plan to pursue graduate degrees in management may want to choose from ECN 465, ECN 481, and ECN 487. Students pursuing an international specialty might be interested in ECN 410 (Economic Development), ECN 465, and ECN 481. Students preparing a public sector specialty might find ECN 431 of particular interest. Those with a human resources interest should select ECN 451. Those interested in macroeconomic theory should consider ECN 481.
The School of Management allows economics majors to take one course per semester in the School of Management. These courses are counted as general electives and not as economics or arts and sciences electives.

Distinction in Biochemistry
The biochemistry B.S. program encourages all of its students to participate in research through its BCM 460 course. For students whose research culminates in a written thesis, it is possible to graduate with Distinction in Biochemistry if the following requirements are met.
First, the student must have an overall cumulative GPA of 3.4 and a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.4 in all natural sciences and mathematics courses taken at Syracuse University.
Second, the student must have taken a minimum of 6 credits of BCM 460.
Third, before completion of the final semester at Syracuse University, the student must make an oral presentation (either poster or platform) on his/her research at one of the following: (1) Syracuse University�s Annual Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference in April; or (2) an external conference sponsored by an outside (non-S.U.) educational institution with its own accredited 4-year biochemistry degree program; or (3) an external conference sponsored by a nationally-recognized scientific society with a biochemistry component (e.g., ACS, FASEB, Biophysical Society). A symposium specifically designed for undergraduate researchers from multiple institutions and sponsored by a regional or local chapter of a national scientific society does qualify as external, even if it is physically located at Syracuse University.
Fourth, the written thesis must be judged by a committee of readers selected from among  the biochemistry program faculty listed in the Syracuse University Course Catalog. The student is responsible for selecting potential readers and obtaining their consent. The committee of readers should include the research supervisor, but in any case, must include at least one member whose primary appointment is in the Biology Department, and one member whose primary appointment is in the Chemistry Department.

Critical Reflections on Ethical and Social Issues Requirement

Program Director:Return to: College of Arts and Sciences 
Students are required to take three courses from the approved list that follows. These courses are designed to encourage students to think critically about social and ethical issues that are relevant to contemporary life. They are from a variety of departments and programs and will demonstrate the relevance of study in the liberal arts to gaining critical perspectives on aspects of contemporary society. Many of these courses may simultaneously be used to partially satisfy other Liberal Arts Core requirements.
Most of the courses that satisfy the Critical Reflections on Ethical and Social Issues Requirement promote the University�s core value of diversity. They help students to reflect on the diversity of peoples, social groups and cultures that surround them in contemporary life. Many other courses in the liberal arts curriculum outside those on the list of Critical Reflections courses also serve this goal.

Courses for the Critical Reflections Requirement
Transfer and other credit are not accepted for the Critical Reflections Requirement except when they are included in an Associate Degree as defined in articulation agreements.
These courses that fulfill the Critical Reflections requirement must be successfully completed by the student in the academic year in which they are listed in the Liberal Arts Core Guidebook.

Description
The Bachelor of Science in Studio Arts is designed for the student pursuing an intensive studio

art experience alongside another field/s of academic study. With 50% of coursework taking place in the Studio Art major and the remaining credits used to pursue another or multiple other degrees. Focused on the development of interdisciplinary practices that integrate studio art and additional academic disciplines, this degree is designed for the artist and entrepreneur who will create the unanticipated art forms and cultural phenomena that cannot be anticipated by traditional arts education. Often students have a strong interest in combining their art practice with academic subjects such as Psychology, History, Politics, Business etc.; and who want to pursue a career as a professional artist or entrepreneur utilizing both creative and academic fields.

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Develop a coherent art practice that demonstrates a thorough understanding of the materials, processes, and concepts relevant to your work.
2. Apply creative thinking skills to develop and solve problems within your work. 
3. Use research skills to develop and articulate an understanding of contemporary art, art history, and visual culture, as they relate to your art practice. 
4. Demonstrate critical thinking and communication skills to meaningfully critique both your own and others� work.

Atrocity Studies and the Practices of Social Justice Minor

Program Director:Contact:
Julia M. White
Teaching and Leadership

jmwhit02@syr.edu
  The Atrocity Studies and Practices of Social Justice Minor provides a broad interdisciplinary approach to an understanding of the Holocaust (which was the foundation of international treaties and conventions and the event that defined the word genocide), other genocides / atrocities that took place before and after the Holocaust, issues of social justice and violations of human rights, and efforts to confront the past and transform the future. It addresses a central tenet of education: What does it mean to be a responsible citizen in a democratic society?
  The minor will help students realize that:
� Democratic institutions and values are not automatically sustained but need to be appreciated, nurtured, and protected.
� Silence and indifference to the suffering of others, or to the infringement of human and civil rights in any society-however unintentionally-serve not only to perpetrate the problems but also often to intensify them.
� Genocides/atrocities and human rights violations occur because individuals, organizations and governments make choices that not only legalize discrimination, but also allow prejudice, hatred and ultimately mass murder to occur.
� Individuals and groups can practice and work towards social justice in society and the world.
Admission to the minor requires a 2.8 cumulative grade point average.  The minor requires 18 credits, as explained below.   At least 12 of the 18 credits must be upper division (300 level or above).  Students should become familiar with their college�s rules about double counting courses for more than one minor, and/or for a major and minor, and should carefully plan out how courses will fit with their primary major. Courses must be approved by the minor coordinator. Appropriate courses will be added to the lists below as they occur.

This Integrated Learning Major (ILM) in Environment, Sustainability, and Policy is designed to introduce students to and ground them in the interdisciplinary study of environmental science, sustainability, and policy necessary to understand the nature of our changing planet, contribute solutions to advance sustainability, and become more engaged global citizens. 
As a growing human population seeks to meet its needs, competing demands on the environment threaten the planet�s systems for supporting and sustaining life. Rising to the challenge of planetary stewardship requires the integration of multiple scientific disciplines exploring the planet�s vital functions and an understanding of how the complexities of human societies across places and time periods shape views of and approaches to protecting or exploiting the planet�s resources and pursuing sustainability. The ILM�s foundation is built on two pillars integral to finding solutions to environmental problems and sustainability: (1) the science of the planet�s interacting natural systems (environmental sciences) and (2) the examination of human perceptions, institutions, and policies toward the environment from the social sciences and humanities (environmental studies). This major�s integration across traditionally isolated lenses of natural and human sciences provides a unique perspective toward understanding, examining, and addressing the environment and sustainability.
This ILM may be combined with any other undergraduate major with approval by the program director. While certain majors typically serve as the base major for this ILM, students are encouraged to meet with the program director to determine their best choice of a base major. Dually enrolled students must have a base major within Arts and Sciences|Maxwell.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.
Degree awarded: BA or BS, depending on base major.
Upper-division credits required: 18
Total credits required: 27

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Describe the Earth�s living and non-living systems.
2. Analyze the social, cultural, political, and economic factors that mediate human interactions with the environment.
3. Acquire a wide range of skills for solving global problems of the environment and sustainability.
4. Integrate data, concepts, and methods from multiple disciplines and apply them to studies of and communication about human and environmental systems and sustainability.
5. Identify and interact with key experts, organizations, and communities that need to be a part of sustainable solutions to environmental problems.
6. Link knowledge with actions for sustainable alternatives that integrate scientific, humanist, and social perspectives.

Description
The Bachelor of Science degree in Public Health (BSPH) prepares students for health-related careers in government, private and non-profit organizations that address health promotion and illness prevention in individuals, families and communities.  Service learning and community engagement are key in this major - beginning freshman year and extending through the senior capstone internship, students are working with community partners to improve health in the Syracuse University and regional community.  The 30-credit public health core provides foundational public health knowledge and skills important for entry level public health practice or post-graduate study.  In addition to the public health core, a 15-credit concentration in Addiction Prevention, Health & Society, Healthcare Management, or Community Health Education provides further career-related training.  Students who complete either the Addiction Prevention concentration or Community Health Education concentration are eligible for initial professional credentialing in corresponding careers.  The public health major also provides a pathway to advanced studies in medicine, dentistry, physician assistant, nursing, occupational therapy, or physical therapy.
Intra-University Transfers
The Public Health, BS accepts transfers into the program on a rolling admissions basis who meet the following criteria:
Students with a cumulative GPA 2.7 or higher, in good academic standing at the university and with interest in public health are considered for transfer to the major.

Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary program that offers students an opportunity to take courses in biology, environmental sciences, chemistry, engineering, management, public policy and law. The knowledge gained in these courses will be important for addressing biotechnology-related issues. The combined BS/MS Biotechnology program provides students with advanced scientific training and education, customized to their career plans, as well as targeted professional development and networking experience. It will prepare students for jobs in areas such as the agricultural and food industries, the health professions, environmental conservation, or research in academia.
Admissions
To be eligible for admission to the program, undergraduate students must declare the BS Biotechnology major during the admission process to Syracuse University or anytime thereafter. Students are strongly encouraged to speak to their assigned Biotechnology major advisor regarding the 5-year BS/MS program so that their degree requirements can be met within the designated timeframe.
BS Biotechnology students, and students enrolled in other programs including Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, or others, are eligible to apply to the combined BS/MS Biotechnology program. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis up until July 31st, prior to the beginning of a student�s fourth year as an undergraduate. Interested students must apply through CollegeNet. The materials needed are described below.
Acceptance into the program is based on academic performance, completion of a sufficient proportion of the required BS Biotechnology core courses, and completion of at least one upper-level Biology laboratory course. Decision notifications will be sent to students promptly upon receiving their application.
Students who are not accepted into the combined BS/MS Biotechnology program may still be offered early admission into the regular Biotechnology MS program, at the discretion of the Biotechnology Admissions Committee.
The CollegeNet application consists of the following:
a personal statement (waived for current SU BS Biotechnology majors) outlining the applicant�s interest in the combined BS/MS Biotechnology program (1 page, single-spaced, 12-point Times New Roman font)
a CV or resume 
an unofficial transcript
two (2) faculty recommendation letters
an application.
Program Requirements
Over a period of 5 years, students in this program will complete all the requirements for a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biotechnology, as well as all the requirements for a Master of Science Degree in Biotechnology. Students accepted into the combined BS/MS program will be able to share (�double-count�) up to 15 credits of 500-or 600-level coursework toward the completion of both degrees.
After completion of the program requirements, students will receive the Bachelor�s degree after the fourth year and the Master�s degree after the fifth year.

The Digital Humanities integrated learning major is a 21-credit interdisciplinary program that brings the traditional strengths of the humanities to the study of digital culture. The digital studies major provides students with a structured opportunity to apply the skills of critical thinking, creativity, and historical contextualization to digital cultures and technologies. The major features three introductory core courses, one course focused on technical skills, three elective courses chosen from offerings in various disciplines, and a capstone in which students will demonstrate their mastery and understanding of digital culture. The major seeks to combine a rigorous contextualization of digital technology and culture within a much longer history (and analysis of our own moment in history) with creative experimentation with digital technology.
This Digital Humanities ILM will provide students with an opportunity to deepen their critical, theoretical, and historical perspectives on digital technologies. The major may be paired with any major in the College of Arts and Sciences/Maxwell, which will allow our students to explore focused paths for integrating uses of technology with work in liberal arts disciplines.
This ILM may be combined with any other undergraduate major with approval by the program director. While certain majors typically serve as the base major for this ILM, students are encouraged to meet with the program director to determine their best choice of a base major. Dually enrolled students must have a base major within Arts and Sciences|Maxwell.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core.

Description: 
It is impossible to imagine everyday life without infrastructures. Roads, bridges, terminals, airports, railways, and transit systems enable safe and efficient mobility. Factories depend on infrastructures - manufacturing systems and robots, buildings, power and water systems, storage and waste disposal systems, procurement systems and supply chains - to turn out goods. Computing and network connectivity infrastructures have greatly enriched social life, and new data gathering devices like tiny sensors and UAVs (drones) make up the infrastructure of many smart city installations. Infrastructures are systems of systems.
Infrastructures are often large in size, scope, and reach, technologically complex, and expensive to design and build. Infrastructures can be publicly owned (water supply systems, parks and urban spaces, infrastructure supporting public health and safety) or privately-owned (cellular telephone towers, utility street poles, privately-owned and operated power plants). Infrastructures can be long-lived (the interstate highway system) but they can also be transient (the massive post 9/11 recovery operation in New York City). Public or corporate, digital or not, enduring or transitory, the scope and complexity of infrastructure design and development demand both hard and soft skills, ranging from domain knowledge to project management, effective teamwork, ethics, design discipline, and written and spoken communication.
Today�s infrastructure professionals are challenged to create and employ innovative techniques for building, financing, managing, designing, and envisioning infrastructure. They are asked to integrate skills and knowledge to address such issues as equity and social justice, threats posed by climate change, calls for efficiency in the delivery of government services, and the private sector�s concerns with reducing risk and delivering return on investment.
The Infrastructure, Cities, and the Future minor is designed to prepare students to take on these tasks and to provide leadership in the infrastructure industry. Students completing the program will be prepared to engage in research and commentary as infrastructure policy and practice evolves. More broadly, the minor prepares students to participate in design, policy choices and decision-making about infrastructure development and management, whether as informed citizens or infrastructure professionals.
Admission:
This minor is available to all University undergraduate students with a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or above. To be admitted to the program, students must submit a Declaration of Minor form signed by their academic advisor; Infrastructure, Cities, and the Future minor coordinator; and the academic dean of their home school/college.

Student Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of the program, students will be able to:
1. Communicate the role that infrastructure plays (currently and historically) in the life of communities, cities, and larger geographical/political regions.
2. Apply fundamental critical thinking skills to the analysis of future infrastructure needs; community, economic, and societal impacts, and proposals for new infrastructure projects.
3. Analyze and recommend appropriate traditional and innovative tools to support the finance, delivery, design, and management of infrastructure projects.
4. Demonstrate creativity, rigor and critical thinking in the design of infrastructure and smart city systems.
5. Apply principles of ethics, sustainability, and resilience to infrastructure project design and evaluation.
6. Participate knowledgeably and effectively in wide ranging public debates on infrastructure needs, project design, and public policy-related infrastructure measures.
7. Demonstrate project management skills and the ability to effectively manage client and project team relations.
Requirements
To complete a minor in Infrastructure, Cities, and the Future, students are required to declare the minor using the minor declaration form, and take a minimum of six courses (at least 18 credits) as described below with a combined GPA of at least 2.00.
Core Courses (9 Credits)
BUA 275/CEE 275 Infrastructure and Society
BUA 361/CEE 361 Evolution of an Infrastructure Project
BUA 362/CEE 362 Infrastructure Design Capstone Course
Elective Courses (9 Credits)
Three courses drawn from a list of allowable courses from ECS, Maxwell, Whitman, VPA, Falk, and the iSchool.  The Minor Coordinator has an updated list of elective courses for the current academic year.
Notes
This is an interdisciplinary minor which combines material from the disciplines of business, engineering, policy, design, and information science and applies this content to the study of infrastructure management and development.

Many students will satisfy the Quantitative Skills Requirement by taking a pair of statistics courses. MAT 121 provides introductions to statistics with emphasis on the analysis of real data sets. It does not assume any prerequisite mathematical preparation, although it is desirable that students have a reasonable level of competence in high school algebra. Students who complete MAT 121 may consider completing the sequence with one of the following: GEO 386, MAX 201, PSC 202, PSY 252, SOC 318, or SWK 361. Consult your advisor.
Only students who have mastered high school algebra should contemplate any of the remaining options for satisfying the quantitative skills requirement.
FOR STUDENTS NOT MAJORING IN SCIENCES
The sequence MAT 221-222, Elementary Probability and Statistics, is designed for non-science majors and introduces basic concepts of probability and statistics and their applications. It is more mathematically rigorous than MAT 121-122.
FOR STUDENTS INTERESTED IN PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES
Students should consult with their academic advisor to determine which sequence will work best for them.
FOR STUDENTS WITH STRONG MATHEMATICS BACKGROUNDS
Students with strong mathematics backgrounds should consider taking calculus. MAT 285 is designed for students planning to major in the social or life sciences, whereas MAT 295 is designed for engineering students and science and mathematics majors. Students with a weak background in trigonometry and analytic geometry should take one of the sequences MAT 194-285 or MAT 194-295.
EXEMPTIONS AND ALTERNATIVES
Calculus. Any student who completes with a grade of C or better any one calculus course numbered 284 or above has satisfied the Quantitative Skills requirement.
Advanced Credit Exam. Any student receiving 3 or more credits in calculus by advanced credit exam satisfies the Quantitative Skills requirement.

IDEA Course Requirement

Program Director:The IDEA course requirement provides undergraduate students the opportunity to explore concepts in social justice, broadly defined. The IDEA acronym encapsulates the core concepts of Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility. These concepts are integral to models of social justice, and through their examination students can learn about important values, voices, and lives that have been marginalized and erased, along with strategies to create stronger and more just communities.
IDEA courses may be taught in any of the schools and colleges at the university. They vary greatly in topic area and content, but they all incorporate the following learning objectives:
Students will be able to identify ways by which they are shaped by socialization.
Students will learn about structures, systems and impacts of oppression, as well as cultures and practices of resistance.
Students will learn about historical and ideological perspectives, using theoretical framework(s), and incorporating US and/or global contexts.
Students will explore and analyze strategies and tools for developing inclusive, equitable and accessible communities.
In addition to satisfying the IDEA requirement in the student�s program of study, IDEA courses may also satisfy other distributional, major or minor requirements. The IDEA requirement may be completed at any time, but students are encouraged to do so early in their curriculum if possible.
*Crosslisted courses - Students can take any one course within a crosslisted set of courses and it will fulfill the IDEA requirement.

Applications to enter the MA IR portion of the combined degree program will normally be submitted during the spring semester of the junior year, and are allowed once a student has declared their major and completed 75 credit hours toward the bachelor�s degree.
Interested students are encouraged to meet with the admissions director of the MA IR program before applying.  The application package typically requires two letters of recommendation from a Syracuse 
University faculty member, the student�s resume, a Statement of Purpose, and the student�s transcript. GRE and the TOEFL scores will be waived for Syracuse University students.
Student applications that show evidence of sufficient preparation in writing skills and 
quantitative analysis will have a greater chance of being admitted to the program.  The preferred way to demonstrate this competence is by completing a �writing intensive� course and a course that requires quantitative analysis with a grade of B or better prior to applying.  Examples of such courses include, but are not limited to MAX 123, MAX 132 and MAX 201.
Students accepted for graduate study as part of the combined BA/BS-MA program will typically begin the MA portion of the program following completion of their third year of study (six semesters), but are not fully matriculated as graduate students until all requirements for the B.A. degree have been met.

The undergraduate BS major in international relations helps students develop the analytic, cultural, and linguistic skills needed to understand contemporary international affairs, to function effectively in a global environment, and to prepare for further academic or professional study and international career opportunities. This multidisciplinary program provides students with tools and approaches from social science disciplines - anthropology, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology - to explore current issues in international affairs and to conceptualize global citizenship.
The BS degree program is a 48-credit major that provides advanced training in economics, data analytics, and research methods.  

Student Learning Outcomes
1. Recognize global political and economic patterns and relationships.
2. Interpret similarities and differences in cultures, norms, and institutions.
3. Apply theoretical and analytical perspectives in two of nine concentrations: Culture, Identities and Citizenship; Global Health and Environment; International Law and Organizations; Human Rights; International Political Economy; International Security and Diplomacy; Migration; Technology and Global Politics; and Regional Studies with options in Africa, Asia, Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and the Americas.
4. Demonstrate foreign language competency necessary to study or work abroad.
5. Effectively utilize appropriate quantitative or qualitative research tools, analytical techniques, and presentation skills to explain and interpret contemporary issues in international relations.
Major Requirements
Graduation with a Bachelors of Science degree in international relations requires an overall grade point average of 2.0 or higher in upper-division courses for the major, including a grade of �C� or better for work undertaken to fulfill the senior capstone requirement.

Participation in the Maxwell-in-Washington Program, a 15-credit seminar and internship program, is open to all majors. For more information on how this program applies to the International Relations major, please contact the International Relations Program office.
Credits for internships in international relations, including internships abroad and IRP 471 - Global Internship in Washington, D.C., may be counted toward the major upon prior approval by the International Relations Program.
Co-curricular activities including the International Relations Learning Community (a residential program for incoming students), the Sigma Iota Rho Honor Society, Model United Nations Club and Team, International Relations Club, invited speaker series, and other events throughout the Maxwell School are available. More information is available on the International Relations website.
The International Relations Program also offers minors in Global Political Economy and Global Security Studies. For more information, please see the Course Catalog listings for these two programs or visit the International Relations website.
Program faculty will invite majors who meet the eligibility requirements to participate in the Distinction Program. The Distinction Program offers an enhanced research and mentoring experience.  Working closely with a faculty member, Distinction candidates produce a research project of substantially greater depth than the capstone research project required of all international relations majors. In addition, the Distinction Program provides young scholars the skills and support needed to produce a project suitable for presentation at an academic conference or for publication in an undergraduate social science academic journal.  Graduation with Distinction requires a grade of B or higher on the Distinction paper and in the Distinction seminar.

Climate change, environmental degradation, and resource management collectively encompass perhaps the greatest global challenge we face today. Study of the processes that link changes in the atmosphere, ocean, solid earth and biosphere has seen major advances in recent decades. The BS in Environmental Geoscience degree delivers in-depth study of these components of the dynamic earth system and the linkages among them. This fundamental understanding is augmented with practical applications in environments spanning local to global scales. This degree 1) prepares students for careers in environmental resource monitoring, remediation, and regulation associated with positions in private corporations, government agencies, and non-profit organizations, 2) provides the scientific underpinning for students moving into complementary fields of environmental management, law, policy, and education, and 3) offers a solid foundation for students interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the sciences and/or careers in research related to the study of the Earth system in public, corporate, or academic settings.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor�s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
