A minor in Italian consists of a minimum of 18 credits including ITA 202 and 15 other credits in upper-division courses. Twelve of the 15 credits in upper-division courses are in courses taught in Italian; 3 of the credits in upper-division courses may be taught in Italian, in English, or in English with readings in Italian.* A LIT course at the 200 level taught in English by Italian Program faculty may be substituted for an upper-division course taught in English to satisfy the minor requirements.
