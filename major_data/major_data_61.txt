Requirements
The minor in mathematics requires the completion of 21 credits with a grade point average of 2.0 or better. Students must complete the courses listed in the following three items to fulfill the 21 credit requirement.
12 credits of calculus: MAT 295, 296, 397 (MAT 284, 285, 286, are not permissible toward this requirement.)
3 credits in MAT 331 (recommended) or MAT 485
6 credits in one of the following subject areas:
Additional Subject Areas:
Algebra:
MAT 531
MAT 531 - Second Course in Linear Algebra
And one course chosen from
MAT 534 - Introduction to Abstract Algebra
MAT 541 - Introduction to Number Theory
MAT 545 - Introduction to Combinatorics
Analysis:
Any two courses chosen from
MAT 511 - Advanced Calculus
MAT 512 - Introduction to Real Analysis II
MAT 513 - Introduction to Complex Analysis
MAT 562 - Elementary Topology
Applied Mathematics:
Any two courses chosen from
MAT 517 - Partial Differential Equations and Fourier Series
MAT 518 - Fourier Series, Transforms and Wavelets
MAT 532 - Applied Linear Algebra
MAT 581 - Numerical Methods with Programming
Differential Equations:
MAT 414 - Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations
MAT 517 - Partial Differential Equations and Fourier Series
Geometry:
MAT 531 - Second Course in Linear Algebra
MAT 551 - Fundamental Concepts of Geometry
or
MAT 531 - Second Course in Linear Algebra
MAT 554 - Differential Geometry
Probability and Statistics:
MAT 521 - Introduction to Probability
MAT 525 - Mathematical Statistics
or
MAT 521 - Introduction to Probability
MAT 526 - Introduction to Stochastic Processes
Note:
A student who takes MAT 485 instead of MAT 331 may not use the differential equations sequence to satisfy minor requirements.
A student who has completed the minor requirements stated above but does not have 15 credits of SU coursework toward the minor may use an additional SU course toward the minor. This additional course must be either an upper-level MAT course, or an SU course that has MAT 296 (or a higher-numbered mathematics course) as a prerequisite.
