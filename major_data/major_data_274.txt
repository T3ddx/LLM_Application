Natural Sciences and Mathematics Division
Return to: College of Arts and Sciences 
The Natural Sciences and Mathematics Division encompasses the investigation of natural phenomena, including the development of predictive explanatory systems, and includes the study of numerical and other abstract structures and relations. These are central concerns of the departments of Biology, Chemistry, Communication Sciences and Disorders, Earth and Environmental Sciences, Physics, and Mathematics. Hence most courses satisfying the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Division requirements come from these departments.
The Natural Sciences and Mathematics List
Students must take at least four courses from this list, including a 2-course sequence (indicated below) and a course with a laboratory to complete the requirement for four courses in this division. No more than three courses may be taken from a single department or program (even if the courses of the department or program are in more than one division).
