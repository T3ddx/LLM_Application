More than two thirds of the Asian American population is comprised of immigrants whose personal and migration histories, educational achievements and attitudes have been molded by their Asian heritages and who continue to maintain connections with their homelands. This program was developed out of an awareness that we cannot understand Asian Americans without understanding the histories and cultures of Asia and vice versa, that we cannot understand contemporary Asia without understanding how American politics, capital, religion, culture and Asian American diasporas have shaped countries in that continent.
The minor will consist of 18 credits, 12 of which must be in advanced 300 or higher level coursework.
18 credits, 12 at the 300 or higher level
