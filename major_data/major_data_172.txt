Description
The 124-credit B.S. degree program in nutrition includes coursework in the 1) sciences: chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry; and 2) food: safety, science, systems, and meal management. Students also study nutrition in the health and life span, medical nutrition therapy, community nutrition, nutrition education and counseling. Students can study abroad and have many opportunities for fieldwork and hands-on experiences.
All students who complete degree requirements will be eligible for the B.S. in Nutrition. Additional requirements must be met to receive a dietetics verification statement. Dietetic verification statement requirements are posted on the departmental website in the program handbook.
The nutrition program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) (120 S. Riverside Plaza, Suite 2190, Chicago, IL 60606; 800-877-1600; ext. 5400). Graduates of this program must then complete an accredited Dietetic Internship to gain eligibility for the registration exam. To obtain an internship, a student must usually have a minimum GPA of 3.4 and related work experience. Effective January 1, 2024, a master’s degree is required for eligibility for the registration examination for dietitians.
