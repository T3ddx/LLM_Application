Minor Requirements
The minor in art history requires 18 credits of coursework. Of these credits, 3 must be for lower-level HOA courses (299 level and below), and 12 must be for upper-level HOA courses (300 level and above). The remaining 3 credits can be fulfilled by a lower or upper-level HOA course. Students may petition to have up to 3 credits of art history courses taken outside the department count toward the minor.
