Program Description
The BFA in Arts Education emphasizes diverse creative processes as laboratories for the exploration of the materials and forms through which human beings have historically shaped enduring ideas, negotiated identity, and organized all that we know and value. The Arts Education program provides students with instruction in artistic systems for producing masterfully wrought forms, communicating cultural languages, and instigating social transformations. Students learn the basic skills for building curriculum and leading project-based learning engagements that champion the crucial function of creative practices in society. The program also prepares students by providing a solid ethical foundation, immersion in the principles of inclusion and the advantages of diversity, along with a thorough understanding of STEAM curriculum-making wherein traditional STEM subjects in education are activated by the Arts at the center. Emphasis on socially responsible approaches to artmaking and design, unconventional field placements and partners, and an interdisciplinary approach to the arts in relation to the humanities and sciences are woven throughout the program coursework.
This is a 124-credit degree intended to facilitate the overlap of two VPA academic majors-one rooted in studio production, and the other committed to inspiring and developing creativity in the next generation of artists, designers, communicators, and innovators. Students majoring in Arts Education must take the following requirements, specialized course electives, and are encouraged to study abroad for one semester.
