Syracuse University’s curricular programs in forensic science, supported by the Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute in the College of Arts and Sciences, apply broad interdisciplinary scientific research and theory to real-world legal and security issues. Students can pursue an M.S. in Forensic Science, a combined M.S. in Forensic Science and J.D. in Law, an M.S. in Biomedical Forensic Sciences, a Certificate of Advanced Study in Medicolegal Death Investigation, an undergraduate Integrated Learning Major in Forensic Science, a Minor in Forensic Science, or a Certificate in Medicolegal Death Investigation.
Minor in Forensic Science
The minor in forensic science provides students with an understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles behind the application of scientific techniques to forensic investigations and to the criminal justice system. Recent advances in basic scientific research have had a rapid and dramatic impact in these fields and it is only through an understanding of these fundamental scientific concepts that the legal system may be effective in criminal investigations. A minor in forensic science offers a strong complement for students interested in criminal justice to major areas of study such as anthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, geology, psychology, engineering, pre-medicine, sociology, and pre-professional degree programs. The minor in forensic science is open to all students at Syracuse University.
