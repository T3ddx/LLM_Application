The Creative Writing Minor in the English Department is designed for students who have an interest in developing their skills as writers and readers of creative nonfiction, fiction, and poetry but need to fulfill the requirements of other majors.  Students will take a series of six creative writing classes in order to learn to think as writers do, to understand the aesthetic and moral choices writers confront as they write, and become familiar with contemporary writing practices.  Through a mix of workshop, imitation classes and a topics course, students will have ample opportunity for frequent and extensive writing and rewriting under the guidance of the distinguished faculty of the nationally ranked MFA in Creative Writing.
