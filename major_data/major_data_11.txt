Biotechnology is an interdisciplinary program that offers students an opportunity to take courses in biology, environmental sciences, chemistry, engineering, management, public policy and law that will be important for addressing biotechnology-related issues. This program will help students prepare for jobs in areas such as the biotechnology industry, health professions, pharmaceutical and agricultural industry, environmental conservation and research in academia. The program requires many of the same basic courses as the B.S. degree in Biology, with additional courses in engineering, management and public policy. A variety of elective courses in biology, engineering, law, management and public policy can be used to fulfill the major requirements as well. A senior year capstone class (Biotechnology Seminar) and valuable industry internships and research opportunities are also part of this major.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor’s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Be able to recognize and distinguish theories, concepts and principles from the major sub-fields of biology relevant to biotechnology
2. Recognize and practice methods and techniques of molecular biology that are often applied to problems in biotechnology
3. Identify and apply concepts and methods in selected areas of Bioengineering and Materials Science that can be relevant to biotechnology applications
4. Identify and apply concepts and methods of Public Policy and Management that can be relevant to biotechnology applications
