Of these 18 credits, 6 may be earned in courses from 100 and 200-level lower-division music history courses (excluding HOM 125 and HOM 126, which do not count toward the minor), while the remaining 12 must be earned in upper-level courses (300 level and above). Students may petition to have up to 6 credits of selected topics courses in music history (HOM 300, HOM 400, HOM 500 or HOM 600), departmental experience credits, and independent studies (HOM 470 and HOM 490) count toward the minor. In addition, students may petition to have up to 3 credits of music history courses taken outside the department count toward the minor.
