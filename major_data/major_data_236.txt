Description
The music education program, which leads to a Bachelor or Music degree, is designed to give students a strong foundation in musical and teaching skills and to enable them to obtain initial certification for public school teaching (all grades) in New York State and other states with which there are reciprocal arrangements.
Music education students are dually enrolled in the Setnor School of Music and the School of Education. They may elect one of five emphases: brass, choral/general, woodwind, percussion, or strings. By graduation, students are expected to have achieved competencies in all the musical disciplines (e.g., principal and secondary performance areas, music history and theory, sight-singing and dictation, conducting, and ensemble participation) in addition to teaching competencies in such areas as classroom management techniques, music technology, and curriculum development skills. Students must have achieved a 3.0 average in music and education courses, with an overall GPA of at least 3.0 before being permitted to enter into the upper division sequence (junior year) and to student teach (senior year). Students also have opportunities to develop techniques of teaching general music as well as techniques for directing performance ensembles. Our students are also committed to inclusion, anti-racist pedagogy, and equity in the music classroom.
In addition to writing courses, academic credits are required in the following: 6 credits of social science (psychology or sociology), 3 credits in mathematics, 3 credits in the sciences, and 3 credits of multicultural humanities. One course (minimum 3 credits) in a language other than English (including American Sign Language), or equivalent competency established by examination or level three of high school study is also required. If requirement has already been met in high school or by examination, one 3-credit liberal arts elective must be taken in its place.
