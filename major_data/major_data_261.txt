Sustainable Construction Management Minor
Coordinators: Dr. Paul Crovella
The sustainable construction minor is available to all ESF undergraduates (except students in construction management) and prepares students for careers related to sustainable construction. The objective of the minor is to provide a fundamental understanding of the concepts and methods used to take a design into the field and build a quality sustainable structure in the most efficient and effective manner with minimal environmental impact. Admission to the minor requires sophomore status and a cumulative grade point average of 2.70 or higher.
A cumulative grade point average of 2.000 or higher is required for the sustainable construction management courses in order to obtain the minor.
