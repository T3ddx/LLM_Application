Professionals in technically demanding fields are commonly asked to apply their expertise to other seemingly unrelated disciplines. As a result, they must have a comprehensive understanding of not only their own field, but also secondary knowledge of another broadly based, often interdisciplinary, field of study. A chemist might lend his or her expertise to a matter of legal or ethical importance. A curator might evaluate scientific and historical evidence about a painting’s authenticity. A journalist might research a story involving science, medicine, and technology.
The major in Ethics will integrate with the following majors: management, television/radio/film, broadcast/newspaper journalism, engineering, computer science, biology, biomedical and chemical engineering, political science, public health, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and international relations, but other combinations may also be possible with approval of the director.
This ILM may be combined with any other undergraduate major with approval by the program director. While certain majors typically serve as the base major for this ILM, students are encouraged to meet with the program director to determine their best choice of a base major. Dually enrolled students must have a base major within Arts and Sciences|Maxwell.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.
This synergistic approach adds scholarly mettle to both the major and the interdisciplinary program, while exploiting their connective properties. First- and second-year courses contemplating the Integrated Learning Program in Ethics are advised to take one of the following courses: ANT 185, PHI 191/PHI 192/PHI 209, REL 252, or WGS 230/SOC 230.
Admittance requires an overall 3.0 GPA and a B or better in both PHI 391 and PHI 393.
