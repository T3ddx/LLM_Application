The education studies minor provides useful skills and experiences for students not enrolled in the School of Education, who go on to pursue careers in communication, business, science, or the arts. The minor in education is purposely broad in scope to allow students to accomplish any and all of the following objectives: (1) to explore education as a professional field of study, (2) to learn about issues in and the practice of education, (3) to prepare for graduate programs in education and related professional fields, and (4) to develop experience in direct work with children and adults through education and counseling.
The minor alone does not provide teacher certification. Students who want to complete prerequisites that will help them more expeditiously complete a master’s degree in teaching, counseling, instructional development, or other related education fields should consult with a faculty advisor in education about their career plans. Students interested in teacher certification through an SU undergraduate program must enroll in one of the teaching preparation programs offered by the School of Education (in some cases as a dual program with another SU college).
Course selection for the minor should be done in consultation with the minor advisor. The minor will consist of 18 credits, including general courses in education and several that are focused on a particular area of education. At least 12 credits must be 300 level or above.
A 2.5 grade point average is required for admittance to the minor.
