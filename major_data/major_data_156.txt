Description:
This combined degree is for students who want to complete consecutively the Bachelor of Science (BSEE) and Master of Science (MSEE) degree in electrical engineering. The combined degree is designed to be completed in 5 years. Two courses (6 credits) at the 500- level or higher may be counted towards both the Bachelor’s and the Master’s degrees. The student is expected to be certified for the Bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and for the Master’s degree at the end of the fifth year.
Students should apply to the combined degree program in the summer before their senior year. Admission decisions will be made on the academic performance of applicants. Students need to use the established process for regular MS applications.
*Students are accepted for graduate study after completion of the third year of study but are not fully matriculated as graduate students until bachelor’s degree requirements have been met. The undergraduate degree is awarded before completion of the graduate degree. The graduate courses are included in the undergraduate tuition and appear only on the undergraduate record, and grades calculate only toward the undergraduate GPA. A block of transfer credits labeled as “transferred from SU undergraduate record” appears on the graduate record, if needed, and applies credit hours toward the graduate degree.
*See Online Course Catalog, Academic Rules, Degrees, TABLE L Combined Undergraduate/Graduate Degree Programs.
