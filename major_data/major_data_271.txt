Critical Reflections on Ethical and Social Issues Requirement
Return to: College of Arts and Sciences 
Students are required to take three courses from the approved list that follows. These courses are designed to encourage students to think critically about social and ethical issues that are relevant to contemporary life. They are from a variety of departments and programs and will demonstrate the relevance of study in the liberal arts to gaining critical perspectives on aspects of contemporary society. Many of these courses may simultaneously be used to partially satisfy other Liberal Arts Core requirements.
Most of the courses that satisfy the Critical Reflections on Ethical and Social Issues Requirement promote the University’s core value of diversity. They help students to reflect on the diversity of peoples, social groups and cultures that surround them in contemporary life. Many other courses in the liberal arts curriculum outside those on the list of Critical Reflections courses also serve this goal.
Courses for the Critical Reflections Requirement
Transfer and other credit are not accepted for the Critical Reflections Requirement except when they are included in an Associate Degree as defined in articulation agreements.
These courses that fulfill the Critical Reflections requirement must be successfully completed by the student in the academic year in which they are listed in the Liberal Arts Core Guidebook.
