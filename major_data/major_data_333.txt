Admission Requirements:
Applications to enter the MA IR portion of the combined degree program will normally be submitted during the spring semester of the junior year, and are allowed once a student has declared their major and completed 75 credit hours toward the bachelor’s degree.  
Interested students are encouraged to meet with the admissions director of the MA IR program before applying.  The application package typically requires two letters of recommendation from a Syracuse University faculty member, the student’s resume, a Statement of Purpose, and the student’s transcript. GRE and the TOEFL scores will be waived for Syracuse University students.
Student applications that show evidence of sufficient preparation in writing skills and quantitative analysis will have a greater chance of being admitted to the program.  The preferred way to demonstrate this competence is by completing a “writing intensive” course and a course that requires quantitative analysis with a grade of B or better prior to applying.  Examples of such courses include, but are not limited to MAX 123, MAX 132 and MAX 201.
Students accepted for graduate study as part of the combined BA/MA program will typically begin the MA portion of the program following completion of their third year of study (six semesters) but are not fully matriculated as graduate students until all requirements for the B.A. degree have been met.
