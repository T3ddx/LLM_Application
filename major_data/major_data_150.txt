Description
The mission of the computer and information science programs is to assist students to be ready for work and ready for change. This means preparing students to make professional contributions to computer and information science immediately upon graduation and throughout their professional careers, and to adapt to technological and societal changes.
This program is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.
The programs in computer science prepare professionals who will adapt to constant changes in technology and who will be leaders in developing the new technologies of the Information Age. The multidisciplinary nature of the curricula offers students a high degree of flexibility to design a program of study tailored to their interests and professional aspirations.
Computer science focuses on programming, algorithms, large-scale software development, and the principles of computing that underlie these areas. Syracuse’s program weaves together an emphasis on fundamental principles with new developments in computing, producing graduates prepared either to begin careers or to pursue advanced studies in the field.
With this program you will have opportunities to learn about:
Computer and internet security
Artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop machines that can work among humans.
Operating system design to develop the next innovation to change Windows, Mac OS X and Unix or to invent a completely new operating system.
Innovative thinking so you can design programs that control rockets, future search engines, and cars that drive themselves.
Mathematics to reveal the limits of today’s computers and explore the possibility of a new kind of computer that has yet to be imagined.
Problem solving, independent thinking and team collaboration in developing a large-scale software systems with other computer scientists and software engineers.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions
2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline
3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts
4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles
5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline
6. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions
Distribution and Core Requirements
The BS degree in Computer Science requires a minimum of 120 credits. The requirements are divided into a general education section, a mathematics section, and a major section.
General Education Section
Completion of the general education section requires at least 47 credits of coursework, as follows. Each student is required to complete 6 credits of writing (WRT 105, WRT 205) and 3 credits in presentational skills by taking at least one course out of the following:
CRS 225 - Public Advocacy
CRS 325 - Presentational Speaking
IST 344 - Information Reporting and Presentation
Natural Sciences
The student is further required to complete 8 credits of natural sciences,  as follows.
PHY 211 - General Physics I
PHY 221 - General Physics Laboratory I
In addition, students must complete one of the following options: PHY 212 and PHY 222; CHE 106 and CHE 107; or  BIO 121 and BIO 122.
Social Science and Humanities
The student is required to complete 21 credits in social science and humanities (A/SS/H), including the following two courses:
PHI 251 - Logic
ECS 392 - Ethical Aspects of Engineering and Computer Science
The remaining 15 credits may be chosen from courses offered by the College of Arts and Sciences or by the College of Visual and Performing Arts.
(See exclusions in the Undergraduate Student Handbook)
Free Electives
Finally, each student has 8 credits of free electives. This requirement can be satisfied by any courses except for CPS courses and certain remedial courses. A list of such courses can be obtained from the CIS program office.
Mathematics Section
The mathematics section requires at least 15 credits of math. The student must complete the following courses:
MAT 295 - Calculus I
MAT 296 - Calculus II
 MAT 397 - Calculus III
or
MAT 331 - First Course in Linear Algebra
 CIS 321 - Introduction to Probability and Statistics
Major Section
The major section consists of ECS 101 - Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science, CIS 151 - Fundamentals of Computing and Programming, the 34-credit computer science core (listed below), and 18-credits of upper-division technical electives.



Computer Science Core
CIS 252 - Elements of Computer Science
CIS 341 - Computer Organization & Programming Systems
CIS 351 - Data Structures
CIS 352 - Programming Language: Theory & Practice

Academic Standards
Students are required to meet academic standards as follows: no grade below C- will satisfy the requirements for the 6 credits of writing, for the mathematics section, for the computer science core, and the 18 credits of upper-division technical electives. The computer science core must be completed with a B- (2.667) average.
Upper Division Technical Electives
Students must complete 18 credits of upper division electives chosen from the following listing. At least 9 credits of the upper division technical electives must be in computer science or computer engineering.
Arts and Sciences
Students may choose any mathematics courses numbered about 400, unless specifically excluded (e.g., MAT 521 and MAT 485). Students may also choose from the following philosophy courses:



PHI 378 - Minds and Machines
PHI 451 - Logic and Language
