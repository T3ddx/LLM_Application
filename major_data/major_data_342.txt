Introduction:
The School of Information Studies offers a bachelor of science degree (B.S.) in Applied Data Analytics.  As data and technology become increasingly fundamental to how businesses operate, understanding how to derive, communicate, and apply data-driven insights to organizational problems is an in-demand skill set that will give you an advantage over other graduates in your field.
Every industry and profession needs graduates who can use data to deepen their knowledge, further their research, and make better business decisions. That is why our Bachelor of Science in Applied Data Analytics is so popular with our students, our faculty, and our corporate partners.  It is a program with a strong emphasis on the applications of data science to enterprise operations and processes, particularly in the areas of data capture, management, analysis and communication for decision making.
