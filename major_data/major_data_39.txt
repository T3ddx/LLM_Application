Geographers are concerned with social, spatial, and environmental processes in human and natural systems. Their work focuses on critical theory, practical application, analysis, and interventions. Of central importance to the study of geography are relations between social groups, as well as between people and their natural and human-built environments. Coursework for a Geography minor spans the social and natural sciences and includes cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and other technologies for analyzing spatial information. Many geography students combine majors and minors in other fields to prepare themselves for careers in environmental analysis and resource management, urban and regional development, international relations, conflict resolution, public service, and more.
