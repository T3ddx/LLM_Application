The minor in cognitive science offers study in recent interdisciplinary research on cognition. Relevant courses are offered in several departments and colleges, including College of Engineering and Computer Science and the linguistics, philosophy, and psychology departments within the College of Arts and Sciences. Students may pursue study in cognition science either by enrolling in the interdisciplinary minor or by majoring in selected studies in cognitive science (see selected studies). Faculty advisors are available within each of these units to help students plan a course of study.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Students will be able to demonstrate an understanding of the integrated and complementary ways in which research in multiple disciplines study cognition.
2. Students will be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of research on cognition from at least three different disciplinary perspectives.
3. Students will be able to read original research reports on cognition and explain them to others both orally in writing.
