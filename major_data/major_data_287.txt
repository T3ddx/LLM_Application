Description
The Bachelor of Science in Studio Arts is designed for the student pursuing an intensive studio

art experience alongside another field/s of academic study. With 50% of coursework taking place in the Studio Art major and the remaining credits used to pursue another or multiple other degrees. Focused on the development of interdisciplinary practices that integrate studio art and additional academic disciplines, this degree is designed for the artist and entrepreneur who will create the unanticipated art forms and cultural phenomena that cannot be anticipated by traditional arts education. Often students have a strong interest in combining their art practice with academic subjects such as Psychology, History, Politics, Business etc.; and who want to pursue a career as a professional artist or entrepreneur utilizing both creative and academic fields.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Develop a coherent art practice that demonstrates a thorough understanding of the materials, processes, and concepts relevant to your work.
2. Apply creative thinking skills to develop and solve problems within your work. 
3. Use research skills to develop and articulate an understanding of contemporary art, art history, and visual culture, as they relate to your art practice. 
4. Demonstrate critical thinking and communication skills to meaningfully critique both your own and others’ work.

The course content includes, but is not limited to, conceptualization, process, product, and critique of creative work in studio practice. These courses meet for a much longer time, for a minimum of four hours per week for the duration of the semester. Usual meeting patterns are: the class meets once per week for four+ hours, or the class meets twice per week, usually for two or more hours each.
