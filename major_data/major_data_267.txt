Biochemistry is the study of the molecular basis of life. Lying at the interface between chemistry and biology, biochemistry is concerned with the structure and interaction of proteins, nucleic acids, and other biomolecules as related to their function in biological systems. As one of the most dynamic areas of science, biochemistry has led to improved medicines and diagnostic agents, new ways of controlling disease, and greater understanding of the chemical factors that control our general health and well-being.
The bachelor of science degree in biochemistry is appropriate for students pursuing advanced degrees in biochemistry, molecular biology, and biophysics, as well as in the biomedical fields and health professions.
For all Arts and Sciences|Maxwell students, successful completion of a bachelor’s degree in this major requires a minimum of 120 credits, 96 of which must be Arts and Sciences|Maxwell credits, completion of the Liberal Arts Core requirements, and the requirements for this major that are listed below.
Dual Enrollments:
Students dually enrolled in Newhouse* and Arts and Sciences|Maxwell will complete a minimum of 122 credits, with at least 90 credits in Arts and Sciences|Maxwell coursework and an Arts and Sciences|Maxwell major.
*Students dually enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences|Maxwell as first year students must complete the Liberal Arts Core. Students who transfer to the dual program after their first year as singly enrolled students in the Newhouse School will satisfy general requirements for the dual degree program by completing the Newhouse Core Requirements.

Distinction in Biochemistry
The biochemistry B.S. program encourages all of its students to participate in research through its BCM 460 course. For students whose research culminates in a written thesis, it is possible to graduate with Distinction in Biochemistry if the following requirements are met.
First, the student must have an overall cumulative GPA of 3.4 and a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.4 in all natural sciences and mathematics courses taken at Syracuse University.
Second, the student must have taken a minimum of 6 credits of BCM 460.
Third, before completion of the final semester at Syracuse University, the student must make an oral presentation (either poster or platform) on his/her research at one of the following: (1) Syracuse University’s Annual Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Conference in April; or (2) an external conference sponsored by an outside (non-S.U.) educational institution with its own accredited 4-year biochemistry degree program; or (3) an external conference sponsored by a nationally-recognized scientific society with a biochemistry component (e.g., ACS, FASEB, Biophysical Society). A symposium specifically designed for undergraduate researchers from multiple institutions and sponsored by a regional or local chapter of a national scientific society does qualify as external, even if it is physically located at Syracuse University.
Fourth, the written thesis must be judged by a committee of readers selected from among  the biochemistry program faculty listed in the Syracuse University Course Catalog. The student is responsible for selecting potential readers and obtaining their consent. The committee of readers should include the research supervisor, but in any case, must include at least one member whose primary appointment is in the Biology Department, and one member whose primary appointment is in the Chemistry Department.
