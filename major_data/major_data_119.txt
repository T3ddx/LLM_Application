The B.S. degree in health and exercise science offers study in the physiological, mechanical, and psychological aspects of physical activity and health behavior. There are three tracks from which to choose in health and exercise science:
The general health and exercise science track prepares students for careers in community health and fitness, corporate fitness, clinical physiology, research, medicine, sports medicine and others.
The pre-physical therapy track allows students the opportunity to interchange some courses in order to meet the requirements of graduate study in physical therapy (DPT) while still leaving options open to the other possible career paths listed above.
The third track, the 3+3 program with SUNY Upstate Medical University, allows students the opportunity to spend three years in our health and exercise science program focusing on physical therapy preparation, and then continue with three years in the Doctorate of Physical Therapy (DPT) program at SUNY Upstate. Students transfer the first year of credits taken from SUNY Upstate to SU, which then completes their fourth year at SU and grants them a B.S. degree in health and exercise science. Please note that this track has specific admissions requirements, described in more detail below.  It is not an option available to current SU students or students transferring to SU from another college or university.
Student Learning Outcomes
1. Synthesize principles from the natural sciences, including the life-sciences, chemistry, and mathematics, to Health and Exercise Science.
2. Explain human physiological function and anatomy.
3. Illustrate how metabolic, muscle, cardiovascular, and pulmonary systems underlie human physical performance.
4. Interpret and critique research findings in the exercise sciences.
5. Demonstrate basic exercise testing protocols that are used to measure human performance in the laboratory.
